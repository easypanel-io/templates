name: Radicale
description:
  Radicale is a small but powerful CalDAV (calendars, to-do lists) and CardDAV
  (contacts) server. It allows you to share calendars and contact lists through
  CalDAV, CardDAV, and HTTP. Radicale supports events, todos, journal entries,
  and business cards. It works out-of-the-box, requiring no complicated setup or
  configuration. Radicale can limit access by authentication and secure
  connections with TLS. It works with many CalDAV and CardDAV clients, stores
  all data on the file system in a simple folder structure, and can be extended
  with plugins. Radicale is GPLv3-licensed free software.
