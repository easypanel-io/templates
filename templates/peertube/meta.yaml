name: PeerTube
description:
  PeerTube is a revolutionary video sharing tool developed by Framasoft, a
  French non-profit organization. It offers an alternative to mainstream video
  platforms, allowing you to establish your own video platform with complete
  independence. Unlike other platforms, PeerTube doesn't rely on opaque
  algorithms or obscure moderation policies. The platforms you visit are built,
  managed, and moderated by their owners. PeerTube also enables platforms to
  connect with each other, forming a large network of autonomous yet
  interconnected platforms. Importantly, PeerTube doesn't depend on advertising
  and doesn't track your activities. It hosts a wide variety of content, with
  over 600,000 videos across 1,000 platforms in the PeerTube network. PeerTube
  is free, open-source, and created for non-commercial purposes, ensuring that
  you are treated as a person, not a product. It is a tool that truly belongs to
  you and respects your fundamental freedoms as a user.
