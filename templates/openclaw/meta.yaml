  OpenClaw is your own personal AI assistant. Any OS. Any Platform. The lobster
  way. 🦞 An open-source personal AI assistant platform that gives you complete
  control over your data and AI interactions. Built for Molty, OpenClaw provides
  a gateway service for WebSocket connections, CLI tools for management, and
  support for multiple channels including WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord,
  and more. Deploy your personal AI assistant with full data ownership and
  privacy.

instructions:
  Once deployed, the gateway service will start automatically. To complete setup,
  you can run the onboarding wizard by executing `node dist/index.js onboard --no-install-daemon`
  in the gateway service console. The gateway runs with `--allow-unconfigured` flag
  to enable initial setup.
