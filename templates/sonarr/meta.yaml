  Sonarr is a Personal Video Recorder (PVR) designed for Usenet and BitTorrent
  users. It monitors multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows
  and automatically grabs, sorts, and renames them. Sonarr can also be
  configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded
  when a better quality format becomes available. It features a calendar to see
  all your upcoming episodes in one convenient location, and a manual search to
  find all the releases and choose the one you want. Sonarr also handles failed
  downloads, automatically blocking the release and trying another one until it
  finds one that works. It is fully integrated with SABnzbd, NZBGet, Kodi, and
  Plex, and supports major platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS, and
  Raspberry Pi.
