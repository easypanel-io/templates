description: Grafana is a powerful, open-source platform designed to visualize,
  query, and understand your metrics. With Grafana, you can create, explore, and
  share dashboards with your team and foster a data-driven culture. It features
  a multi-tenant log aggregation system, Grafana Loki, and a high-scale
  distributed tracing backend, Grafana Tempo. The platform also includes Grafana
  Mimir for scalable and performant metrics backend, Grafana OnCall for on-call
  management, and Grafana k6 for performance testing. Grafana also integrates
  with Prometheus for monitoring Kubernetes and cloud-native applications. The
  platform is designed to compose and scale observability with one or all pieces
  of the stack, providing operational dashboards for your data wherever you need
  it. Whether you're monitoring applications, infrastructure, or APIs, Grafana
  provides the tools you need to understand your data.
