description:
  Manticore Search is an easy to use open source fast database for search. It
  helps thousands of companies from small to large, such as Craigslist, to
  search and filter petabytes of text data on a single or hundreds of nodes, do
  stream full-text filtering, add auto-complete, spell correction,
  more-like-this, faceting and other search-related technologies to their
  websites and applications.

instructions:
  The configuration file within the instance can be found at
  /etc/manticoresearch/manticore.conf. To apply custom settings, ensure that
  this file is mounted to your own configuration file. The ports are
  9306/9308/9312 for SQL/HTTP/Binary, expose them depending on how you are going
  to use Manticore.
