name: Ntfy
description:
  ntfy, pronounced as 'notify', is a simple, HTTP-based pub-sub notification
  service that allows you to send push notifications to your phone or desktop
  from any computer. It operates via scripts using simple HTTP PUT or POST
  requests. This makes it a handy tool for notifying yourself when scripts fail
  or when long-running commands complete. To use ntfy, you simply need to
  install the app on your phone, subscribe to a topic of your choice, and start
  sending messages to your topic. The app is available on Google Play, F-Droid,
  and the App Store. ntfy is open-source and free to use, but also offers paid
  plans for those who wish to support its development.
