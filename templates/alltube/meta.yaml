name: AllTube
description: AllTube is a powerful application that serves as an HTML GUI for
  youtube-dl, a popular command-line program to download videos from YouTube and
  other video hosting websites. The app allows you to easily download videos
  from a wide range of platforms without the need for command-line knowledge. It
  also supports various configurations to cater to different user needs. AllTube
  comes with a JSON API that returns a JSON object generated by youtube-dl,
  allowing you to integrate its functionality into your own projects.
  Additionally, the app offers video conversion capabilities, thanks to its
  ffmpeg dependency, although this feature is disabled by default. AllTube is a
  versatile tool for anyone looking to download and manage online video content
  with ease.
