  Sessy is a self-hosted web application built with Ruby on Rails designed for
  managing and interacting with AWS Simple Email Service (SES). The application
  provides a user-friendly interface for managing email sending operations,
  monitoring email delivery, and working with AWS SES configurations. With

  their email service infrastructure, or anyone looking for a lightweight
  self-hosted solution for AWS SES operations without relying on external
  services.
