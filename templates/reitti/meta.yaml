name: Reitti
description:
  Reitti is a self-hosted journey planning and route optimization application
  designed for public transportation, cycling, and walking routes. Built on
  OpenStreetMap data, it provides intelligent route calculations using the
  Photon geocoding engine for address lookups and PostGIS for spatial data
  processing. The application features a web-based interface for planning
  multi-modal journeys, real-time route optimization, and comprehensive mapping
  capabilities. With RabbitMQ for task queuing and Redis for high-performance
  caching, Reitti delivers fast and responsive route calculations even with
  complex multi-leg journeys. The system can be configured for specific regions
  to optimize data storage and performance, making it suitable for cities,
  regions, or entire countries depending on your needs. Perfect for
  organizations wanting to provide their own journey planning services,
  transportation agencies developing custom routing solutions, smart city
  initiatives requiring private routing infrastructure, or developers building
  location-based applications with routing capabilities without relying on
  commercial APIs or sharing user data with third-party services.
