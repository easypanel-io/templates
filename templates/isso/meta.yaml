name: Isso
description: Isso is a lightweight commenting server designed to be a simple and
  efficient alternative to Disqus. It is written in Python and JavaScript and is
  intended to be a drop-in replacement for Disqus. The app allows anonymous
  comments, maintains user identity, and is easy to administer. It uses
  JavaScript and cross-origin resource sharing for seamless integration into
  static websites. Isso supports comments written in Markdown, and users can
  edit or delete their own comments. It also features a moderation queue, where
  comments are not publicly visible until activated. The app uses an SQLite
  backend, emphasizing that comments are not Big Data. It also provides an easy
  Disqus and WordPress import feature, allowing you to migrate your Disqus or
  WordPress comments without any hassle. The app is configurable and can be
  embedded into your site with a single JS file.
