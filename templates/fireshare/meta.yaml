description:
  Fireshare is a simple, user-friendly app designed to make sharing your game
  clips, videos, or other media a breeze. With Fireshare, you no longer have to
  go through the hassle of uploading your short clips to YouTube and waiting for
  them to process. Instead, you can easily self-host your clips and share them
  with your friends through unique links generated by the app. All you need to
  do is put your videos in a folder and Fireshare will handle the rest. The app
  also allows you to view all your videos, edit their details, and decide
  whether you want them to show up on the public feed. Fireshare also supports
  foldered sorting, allowing you to organize your videos into categories of your
  choosing. The app is mobile-friendly and supports open graph data, allowing
  websites and messaging apps to display the title, description, and video
  thumbnails in your posts.
