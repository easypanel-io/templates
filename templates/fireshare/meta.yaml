name: Fireshare
description: Fireshare is a simple, user-friendly app designed to make sharing
  your game clips, videos, or other media a breeze. With Fireshare, you no
  longer have to go through the hassle of uploading your short clips to YouTube
  and waiting for them to process. Instead, you can easily self-host your clips
  and share them with your friends through unique links generated by the app.
  All you need to do is put your videos in a folder and Fireshare will handle
  the rest. The app also allows you to view all your videos, edit their details,
  and decide whether you want them to show up on the public feed. Fireshare also
  supports foldered sorting, allowing you to organize your videos into
  categories of your choosing. The app is mobile-friendly and supports open
  graph data, allowing websites and messaging apps to display the title,
  description, and video thumbnails in your posts.
