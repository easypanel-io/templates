name: Fireshare
description: Fireshare is a unique application designed to simplify the process
  of sharing your game clips, videos, or other media with friends. Instead of
  going through the hassle of uploading your short clips to YouTube and waiting
  for them to process, Fireshare allows you to self-host your clips and share
  them through unique links. All you need to do is place your videos in a folder
  and Fireshare takes care of the rest. The app also provides a dashboard where
  you can view all your videos, edit their details, and decide whether you want
  them to appear on the public feed. Fireshare also supports foldered sorting,
  allowing you to organize your videos into categories of your choice. The app
  is designed to be user-friendly, with features such as video preview modals,
  direct link and timestamped link sharing buttons, and mobile support.
  Fireshare is the perfect solution for gamers and video enthusiasts looking for
  a simple and efficient way to share their content.
