name: HedgeDoc
description: HedgeDoc, previously known as CodiMD, is an open-source, web-based,
  self-hosted, collaborative markdown editor. It allows you to collaborate on
  notes, graphs, and presentations in real-time, all within your browser. Simply
  share your note-link with your co-workers and they can join in the
  collaboration. HedgeDoc also offers a presentation mode for building and
  presenting slides in markdown, powered by reveal.js. It supports various types
  of graphs, diagrams, and embedded content. The app also features an
  easy-to-use permission system to manage access to your notes, and keeps track
  of revisions, allowing you to revert to any older version of your notes.
  Despite its extensive features, HedgeDoc has low system requirements and can
  even run smoothly on a Raspberry Pi.
