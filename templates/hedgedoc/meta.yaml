  HedgeDoc, previously known as CodiMD, is an open-source, web-based,
  self-hosted, collaborative markdown editor. It allows you to collaborate on
  notes, graphs, and presentations in real-time. Simply share your note-link
  with your co-workers and they can join in the collaboration. The editor runs
  directly in your browser, allowing you to stay in control of your data by
  keeping it on your server. HedgeDoc also offers a presentation mode for
  building and presenting slides in markdown, and supports a variety of graphs,
  diagrams, and embedded content. It features an easy-to-use permission system

  extensive features, HedgeDoc has low system requirements and can run smoothly
  even on a Raspberry Pi.
