name: Listmonk
description: Listmonk is a self-hosted, high-performance mailing list and
  newsletter manager. It is designed to manage millions of subscribers across
  numerous single and double opt-in lists, with custom JSON attributes for each
  subscriber. The app allows you to query and segment subscribers with SQL
  expressions and offers a fast bulk importer for easy integration with external
  CRMs and subscriber databases. Listmonk also provides a simple API for sending
  transactional messages to subscribers using pre-defined templates. These
  messages can be sent via email, SMS, Whatsapp, or any medium via Messenger
  interfaces. The app also includes simple analytics and visualization features,
  powerful dynamic email templates, and a media manager for uploading images for
  email campaigns. It is designed for high performance, with multi-threaded,
  high-throughput, multi-SMTP email queues and fine-grained control over
  throughput and rate limiting. Listmonk respects privacy, allowing subscribers
  to permanently blocklist themselves, export all their data, and wipe all their
  data with a single click.
