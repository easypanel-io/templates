name: Octobox
description:
  Octobox is an innovative app designed to help you manage your GitHub
  notifications more efficiently. With Octobox, you no longer have to worry
  about losing track of important issues or waking up to hundreds of
  notifications. The app adds an extra 'archived' state to each notification,
  allowing you to mark it as 'done'. If there's any activity on an archived
  thread, issue or PR, Octobox will move it back into your inbox. You can also
  search and filter notifications by repository, organization, type, action,
  state, CI status, and reason. Octobox keeps your notifications up to date with
  issue/pull-request status, CI status, labels, and more. The app is free for
  open source projects and offers enhanced notifications for private projects at
  a cost. Octobox is the perfect tool for developers who want to stay organized
  and focused.

benefits:
  - title: Efficient Notification Management
    description:
      Octobox helps you manage your GitHub notifications efficiently, freeing up
      more time for you to focus on your projects. It adds an extra 'archived'
      state to each notification so you can mark it as 'done'. If anything
      happens on an archived thread, issue or PR, Octobox will move it back into
      your inbox.
  - title: Stay Updated
    description:
      With Octobox, you can keep your notifications up to date with
      issue/pull-request status, CI status, labels and more shown alongside
      basic title, organization, repo, and type information.
  - title: Enhanced Notifications
    description:
      By installing the GitHub app, Octobox will pull basic public and private
      notification information and add live information on issue, PR, and CI
      status, labels, authors and more to your organization's notifications.
features:
  - title: Archiving
    description:
      Octobox extends GitHub's notification model by providing an additional
      'archived' status, much like Gmail's email client. Archived notifications
      will not appear in your inbox again unless the thread, issue or PR
      receives a new notification.
  - title: Starring
    description:
      Octobox also adds a starred status to help you highlight important
      notifications with a star so you can come back and find them easily.
      Starred notifications are not social, they are more like bookmarks that
      GitHub stars.
  - title: Muting
    description:
      Muting a notification will mark the notification as read, move it to the
      archive and ignore all further notifications from this thread, issue or
      PR. Muting also sets the thread to ignore:true ignoring further
      notifications on GitHub too.
  - title: Syncing
    description:
      By default Octobox will synchronize every time you hit the synchronize
      button. You can set automatic refresh interval on the settings page.
  - title: Searching
    description:
      "Octobox's search bar supports various filter prefixes. Combine them
      together and with free text searches, for example: 'github enterprise
      type:issue owner:octobox reason:assign'. Many prefixes accept multiple
      arguments when separated by commas or passed twice."
