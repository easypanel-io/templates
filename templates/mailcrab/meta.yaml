name: MailCrab
description: MailCrab is an email test server for development, designed to
  accept all SMTP server emails and provide a web interface for viewing and
  inspecting all incoming emails. It allows users to view formatted mail,
  download attachments, view headers, or view the complete raw mail contents.
  The app runs on all amd64 and arm64 platforms using docker. The backend of the
  app receives email over an unencrypted connection on a configurable port and
  stores all email in memory while the application is running. The frontend of
  the app performs a call to receive all existing email metadata and then
  subscribes for new messages using the websocket connection. The backend also
  accepts commands over the websocket to mark a message as opened, to delete a
  single message or delete all messages.
