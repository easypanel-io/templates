name: MailCrab
description: MailCrab is an email test server designed for development purposes.
  It is an accept-all SMTP server that provides a web interface for viewing and
  inspecting all incoming emails. You can view formatted mail, download
  attachments, view headers, or view the complete raw mail contents. The app
  runs on all amd64 and arm64 platforms using docker. The backend server and the
  frontend of the app are both written in Rust. The backend receives email over
  an unencrypted connection on a configurable port, and all email is stored in
  memory while the application is running. The frontend initially performs a
  call to receive all existing email metadata and then subscribes for new
  messages using the websocket connection. When opening a message, the endpoint
  is used to retrieve the complete message body and raw email. The backend also
  accepts a few commands over the websocket, to mark a message as opened, to
  delete a single message or delete all messages.
