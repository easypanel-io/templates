name: MailCrab
description: MailCrab is an email test server for development, written in Rust.
  It is inspired by MailHog and MailCatcher. The app allows users to view and
  inspect all incoming email, including formatted mail, attachments, headers,
  and raw mail contents. It runs on all amd64 and arm64 platforms using Docker.
  The backend server and frontend are both written in Rust. The backend receives
  email over an unencrypted connection on a configurable port and stores all
  email in memory while the application is running. The frontend communicates
  with the backend via an API and a websocket connection to receive and display
  email metadata and message contents. The app also supports commands to mark
  messages as opened or delete messages. MailCrab can be easily installed and
  run using Docker. TLS and authentication can be enabled for secure
  communication. The app can be configured with a prefix path and can be used
  behind a reverse proxy. By default, messages are stored in memory until the
  app is restarted, but a retention period can be set to automatically clear old
  messages. Sample messages are provided for testing purposes. The app can be
  developed and tested locally using Rust and Trunk.

benefits:
  - title: Easy email testing
    description: MailCrab provides a simple and convenient way to test email
      functionality during development. It allows developers to easily view and
      inspect incoming email without the need for a real email server.
  - title: Lightweight and efficient
    description: MailCrab is written in Rust, which ensures high performance and
      efficient memory usage. The app stores email in memory while running,
      making it lightweight and fast.
  - title: Flexible and customizable
    description: MailCrab can be easily configured and customized to fit different
      development environments. It supports various options such as port
      configuration, TLS and authentication, prefix path, and integration with
      reverse proxies.
features:
  - title: Accept-all SMTP server
    description: MailCrab acts as an SMTP server that accepts all incoming email. It
      can receive email over an unencrypted connection on a configurable port.
  - title: Web interface
    description: MailCrab provides a web interface to view and inspect all incoming
      email. Users can access the interface through a browser and perform
      actions such as viewing formatted mail, downloading attachments, viewing
      headers, and accessing the complete raw mail contents.
  - title: API and websocket communication
    description: MailCrab exposes an API that allows users to retrieve email
      metadata and message contents. The frontend communicates with the backend
      using the API and a websocket connection to receive real-time updates on
      new messages.
  - title: Docker support
    description: MailCrab can be easily installed and run using Docker. It provides
      a lightweight Docker image that can be deployed on all amd64 and arm64
      platforms.
  - title: TLS and authentication
    description: MailCrab supports TLS and authentication for secure communication.
      It can generate a self-signed certificate or use a user-provided
      certificate for encryption. Any username/password combination is accepted.
  - title: Path prefix
    description: MailCrab can be configured with a prefix path for the web
      interface. This allows users to access the interface at a specific URL,
      such as http://localhost:1080/emails.
  - title: Reverse proxy integration
    description: MailCrab can be used behind a reverse proxy for additional security
      and flexibility. A reverse proxy guide is provided to assist with the
      integration.
  - title: Retention period
    description: By default, MailCrab stores messages in memory until the app is
      restarted. However, a retention period can be set to automatically clear
      old messages. This prevents memory overflow when the app receives a large
      number of messages.
  - title: Development and testing
    description: MailCrab can be developed and tested locally using Rust and Trunk.
      The backend server can be started using Cargo, and the frontend can be
      served using Trunk. Test messages are provided for testing purposes.
