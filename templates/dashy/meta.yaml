  Dashy is the ultimate homepage for your homelab, designed to be your personal,
  privacy-respecting dashboard. It is highly customizable and easy to use,
  offering a unique user experience with its built-in themes and UI color
  palette editor. Dashy can auto-fetch icons from the favicon of each of your
  apps or services, and it provides an instant overview of the health of each of
  your apps with status indicators. It also features a simple authentication
  feature for protecting your dashboard, and supports multiple users with
  granular controls. Dashy comes with 50+ pre-built widgets for displaying
  dynamic content from any API-enabled service. It offers alternate views for a
  minimal view or a workspace view, and allows you to choose how to launch your
  apps. Dashy also includes a search and shortcuts feature for easy navigation,
  and an optional cloud backup and sync service for off-site config backup. The
  app supports multiple languages and is easily configurable through a simple
  YAML file or directly through the UI.
