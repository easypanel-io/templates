  authentication feature for protecting your dashboard, and supports multiple
  users with granular controls. Dashy comes with 50+ pre-built widgets for
  displaying dynamic content from any API-enabled service. It offers alternate
  views for a minimal view or a workspace view, and allows you to choose how to
  launch your apps. Dashy also includes a search and shortcuts feature for easy
  navigation, and an optional cloud backup and sync service for off-site config
  backup. The app supports multiple languages and is easily configurable through
  a simple YAML file or directly through the UI.
