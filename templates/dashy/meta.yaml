description: Dashy is the ultimate homepage for your homelab, designed to be
  your personal, privacy-respecting dashboard. It is highly customizable,
  allowing you to create a unique looking dashboard with built-in themes and a
  UI color palette editor. Dashy can auto-fetch icons from your apps or
  services, providing a visually appealing and intuitive interface. It also
  features status indicators, giving you an instant overview of the health of
  each of your apps. For added security, Dashy includes a simple authentication
  feature with support for multiple users and granular controls. The app also
  supports widgets, displaying dynamic content from any API-enabled service.
  With alternate views, launching methods, search & shortcuts, cloud backup &
  sync, and multi-language support, Dashy is a comprehensive tool for managing
  your apps and services. Plus, its configuration is straightforward, with
  real-time validation and hints to guide you through the process.
instructions: After deploying the project, it may take a while before the app is
  available (5 minutes).
