description: Appsmith is a powerful tool designed to help engineers build custom
  software on top of their data. It simplifies internal tool development for
  businesses, streamlining operations, automating processes, and integrating
  multiple apps and data sources. With Appsmith, you can enhance your legacy
  apps with new features, build, maintain, and deploy internal tools faster, and
  connect to any database, SaaS tool, or GraphQL/REST API within a few clicks.
  It also offers a drag and drop feature to build beautiful responsive UI
  without writing a single line of HTML/CSS, and allows you to write in-line
  JavaScript or reusable code blocks to extend your app's functionality.
  Appsmith is secure, with all connections being TLS-encrypted, and credentials
  encrypted with AES-256. It can be self-hosted for total control, privacy, and
  security, and is open-source, giving you full control over your apps forever.
