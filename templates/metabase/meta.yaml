name: Metabase
description: Metabase is a powerful, intuitive application designed to help your
  company explore and analyze data independently. With its user-friendly
  interface and integrated tooling, you can go from zero to dashboard in just 2
  minutes. Metabase allows you to connect directly to over 20+ data sources,
  from your startup's production database to massive data warehouses, and query
  immediately without extracts. It offers a Visual Query Builder that frees your
  data from the confines of SQL, enabling everyone to query in a UI that humans
  actually love. You can easily create and share interactive dashboards, from
  TB-scale analytical workloads to day-to-day operational workflows, with 15+
  visualization types. Metabase also allows you to craft metadata-rich, semantic
  models which let people query on their own, keeping things consistent and
  avoiding repetition. All these features are accessible in a single tab, with
  no CLI needed. Metabase is trusted by over 50,000 companies and is available
  in a free open-source tier, a powerful pay-as-you-go Pro plan, and an
  Enterprise plan.
