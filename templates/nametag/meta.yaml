name: Nametag
description:
  Nametag is a simple, yet effective Personal Relationship Manager (PRM) - like
  a CRM, but for your actual relationships instead of sales prospects. Built
  with Next.js, it helps you manage your personal network by tracking contacts,
  mapping relationships between people, and visualizing your network with
  interactive graphs. Remember when you last talked to an old friend, their
  kids' names, or their birthday. Organize contacts into custom groups, set
  reminders for important dates and staying in touch, and keep all your
  relationship data in one secure, self-hosted location.
