name: Heimdall
description: Heimdall Application Dashboard is a dashboard for all your web
  applications. It doesn't need to be limited to applications though, you can
  add links to anything you like. There are no iframes here, no apps within
  apps, no abstraction of APIs. if you think something should work a certain
  way, it probably does.
