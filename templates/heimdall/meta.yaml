description: "Heimdall Application Dashboard is a versatile dashboard for all
  your web applications. It allows you to add links to any application or site,
  offering a centralized location for all your important web resources. The app
  is designed with simplicity and elegance in mind, ensuring a user-friendly
  experience. It supports three types of items: Generic, Foundation, and
  Enhanced apps. Generic items are basic links that you can customize with a
  name, background color, and icon. Foundation apps are supported applications
  that automatically populate with a default color and icon when you start
  typing their name. Enhanced apps, similar to Foundation apps, also allow you
  to display additional information by entering API credentials. Heimdall
  Application Dashboard is a tool designed to simplify your digital life by
  bringing all your web applications under one roof."
