description:
  Heimdall Application Dashboard is a versatile and visually pleasing dashboard
  for all your web applications. It provides a simple and elegant interface
  where you can add links to any web application or site you frequently use. The
  app is designed with simplicity in mind, avoiding the trap of
  over-complication that many projects fall into. With Heimdall, you can add a
  link to anything, whether it's intrinsically supported or not, by simply
  filling in the name, background color, and the link URL. The app also supports
  Foundation and Enhanced apps. Foundation apps are those supported by Heimdall,
  and Enhanced apps are like Foundation apps but with the added feature of
  displaying extra information automatically by entering API credentials.
  Heimdall is all about making your web application experience smooth, simple,
  and enjoyable.
