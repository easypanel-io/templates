  Cloudreve is a self-hosted cloud storage platform that allows you to build
  your own file hosting and sharing service with support for multiple storage
  backends. Designed as a powerful alternative to commercial cloud storage
  services, Cloudreve provides a feature-rich web interface for uploading,
  organizing, and sharing files with complete control over your data. The
  application supports various storage providers including local storage, remote
  servers, OneDrive, S3-compatible storage, and more, allowing you to leverage
  existing infrastructure or cloud services as backends. Key features include
  drag-and-drop uploads, file previews for images, videos, and documents,
  shareable download links with optional password protection and expiration
  dates, and WebDAV support for seamless integration with desktop and mobile
  applications. Cloudreve offers user management with customizable storage
  quotas, group permissions, and file policies to control how users interact
  with the system. The modern, responsive interface works across devices,
  providing a smooth experience whether accessing from desktop or mobile. Built
  with performance in mind, Cloudreve uses PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
  and Redis for caching, ensuring fast and responsive file operations. Perfect
  for individuals wanting private cloud storage, teams needing collaborative
  file sharing, organizations requiring self-hosted file management, or anyone
  seeking an alternative to commercial cloud storage with complete data
  ownership and privacy.
