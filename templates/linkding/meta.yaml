description: Linkding is a self-hosted bookmark manager that offers a clean and
  optimized user interface for readability. It allows you to organize your
  bookmarks with tags, add notes using Markdown, and even has a 'read it later'
  functionality. You can share bookmarks with other users and perform bulk
  editing. The app automatically provides titles, descriptions, and icons of
  bookmarked websites and creates snapshots of these sites on the Internet
  Archive Wayback Machine. You can import and export bookmarks in Netscape HTML
  format. It also offers light and dark themes for your convenience. The app is
  designed to be minimal, fast, and easy to set up.
instructions: If the login fails with a error 500, please restart the "linkding"
  app service. This can be caused by the database not being properly reachable
  at linkding's first start.
