  Linkding is a self-hosted bookmark manager that allows you to efficiently
  manage and organize your bookmarks. With a clean and optimized user interface,
  you can easily add, share, and edit bookmarks. The app also allows you to add
  notes to your bookmarks using Markdown and provides a 'read it later'
  functionality. It automatically generates titles, descriptions, and icons for
  your bookmarked websites and creates snapshots of them on the Internet Archive
  Wayback Machine. You can also import and export bookmarks in Netscape HTML
  format. The app offers light and dark themes for your convenience. It also
  provides a REST API for developing third-party apps and an admin panel for
  user self-service and raw data access.
instructions:
  If the login fails with a error 500, please restart the "linkding" app
  service. This can be caused by the database not being properly reachable at
  linkding's first start.
