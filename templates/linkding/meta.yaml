description: Linkding is a self-hosted bookmark manager that allows you to
  efficiently manage and organize your bookmarks. With a clean and optimized
  user interface, you can easily add, share, and edit bookmarks. The app also
  allows you to add notes to your bookmarks using Markdown and provides a 'read
  it later' functionality. It automatically generates titles, descriptions, and
  icons for your bookmarked websites and creates snapshots of them on the
  Internet Archive Wayback Machine. You can also import and export bookmarks in
  Netscape HTML format. The app offers light and dark themes for your
  convenience. It also provides a REST API for developing third-party apps and
  an admin panel for user self-service and raw data access.
instructions: If the login fails with a error 500, please restart the "linkding"
  app service. This can be caused by the database not being properly reachable
  at linkding's first start.
