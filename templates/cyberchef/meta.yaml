name: CyberChef
description:
  CyberChef, also known as the Cyber Swiss Army Knife, is a versatile web app
  designed to perform a wide array of 'cyber' operations within a web browser.
  It offers simple encoding methods like XOR and Base64, alongside more complex
  encryption techniques such as AES, DES, and Blowfish. CyberChef also provides
  tools for creating binary and hexdumps, compressing and decompressing data,
  calculating hashes and checksums, parsing IPv6 and X.509, changing character
  encodings, and much more. The app is designed to be user-friendly, enabling
  both technical and non-technical analysts to manipulate data in complex ways
  without the need for intricate tools or algorithms. CyberChef is still under
  active development, with ongoing testing, bug fixing, new feature additions,
  and documentation improvements.

benefits:
  - title: Data Manipulation
    description:
      CyberChef is a web app that enables both technical and non-technical
      analysts to manipulate data in complex ways without having to deal with
      complex tools or algorithms. It simplifies tasks such as simple encoding
      like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish,
      creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data,
      calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing
      character encodings, and much more.
  - title: Intuitive Interface
    description:
      "The app features an intuitive interface with four main areas: the input
      box, the output box, the operations list, and the recipe area. Users can
      easily drag and drop operations into the recipe area and see the outcome
      of their processing in the output box."
  - title: Automated Encoding Detection
    description:
      CyberChef uses a number of techniques to automatically detect which
      encodings your data is under. If it finds a suitable operation that makes
      sense of your data, it displays the 'magic' icon in the Output field which
      you can click to decode your data.
features:
  - title: Drag and Drop
    description:
      Operations can be dragged in and out of the recipe list, or reorganised.
      Files up to 2GB can be dragged over the input box to load them directly
      into the browser.
  - title: Auto Bake
    description:
      Whenever you modify the input or the recipe, CyberChef will automatically
      'bake' for you and produce the output immediately. This can be turned off
      and operated manually if it is affecting performance.
  - title: Breakpoints
    description:
      You can set breakpoints on any operation in your recipe to pause execution
      before running it. You can also step through the recipe one operation at a
      time to see what the data looks like at each stage.
  - title: Save and Load Recipes
    description:
      If you come up with an awesome recipe that you know you’ll want to use
      again, just click 'Save recipe' and add it to your local storage. It'll be
      waiting for you next time you visit CyberChef. You can also copy the URL,
      which includes your recipe and input, to easily share it with others.
  - title: Search
    description:
      If you know the name of the operation you want or a word associated with
      it, start typing it into the search field and any matching operations will
      immediately be shown.
  - title: Highlighting
    description:
      When you highlight text in the input or output, the offset and length
      values will be displayed and, if possible, the corresponding data will be
      highlighted in the output or input respectively.
  - title: Save to File and Load from File
    description:
      You can save the output to a file at any time or load a file by dragging
      and dropping it into the input field. Files up to around 2GB are
      supported.
  - title: Client-Side Processing
    description:
      None of your recipe configuration or input (either text or files) is ever
      sent to the CyberChef web server - all processing is carried out within
      your browser, on your own computer. Due to this feature, CyberChef can be
      downloaded and run locally.
  - title: Deep Linking
    description:
      By manipulating CyberChef's URL hash, you can change the initial settings
      with which the page opens. Supported arguments are recipe, input (encoded
      in Base64), and theme.
