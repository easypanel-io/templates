name: CyberChef
description: CyberChef, often referred to as the Cyber Swiss Army Knife, is a
  versatile web application designed to assist both technical and non-technical
  users in performing a wide range of cyber operations. It offers a simple and
  intuitive interface for carrying out tasks such as encoding and decoding (XOR,
  Base64), encryption (AES, DES, Blowfish), data compression and decompression,
  calculating hashes and checksums, parsing IPv6 and X.509, changing character
  encodings, and much more. The app allows users to manipulate data in complex
  ways without the need for intricate tools or algorithms. CyberChef is also
  equipped with an automated encoding detection feature that attempts to
  identify the encoding of your data and suggest suitable operations. Users can
  save and load their custom recipes for repeated use, set breakpoints on any
  operation, and even share their recipes via URL. All processing is carried out
  within your browser, ensuring that your data never leaves your computer.
