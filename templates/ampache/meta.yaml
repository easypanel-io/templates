name: Ampache
description: Ampache is a web-based audio/video streaming application and file
  manager that allows you to access your music and videos from virtually
  anywhere. With this app, you can browse and manage your music collection
  through a simple web interface, and synchronize local and remote catalogs to
  create a unique, consistent collection. Ampache also allows you to stream your
  music to your preferred player, control it with Localplay, or directly listen
  on the web page with the HTML5 player. The app is completely free and open
  source, and it's compatible with almost any internet-enabled device, including
  your phone, tablet, or television. Whether you're at home, at work, or on
  vacation, Ampache lets you take your music with you.
instructions: MySQL Username is "admin". The logs will show a line that says
  "mysql -uadmin -pjnzYXLz7cMzq -h<host> -P<port>"". The password is everything
  after "-p", in this case "jnzYXLz7cMzq".
