description:
  Ampache is a web-based audio/video streaming application and file manager that
  allows you to access your music and videos from anywhere, anytime. With this
  app, you can browse and manage your music collection through a simple web
  interface, and even synchronize local and remote catalogs to create a unique,
  consistent collection. Ampache also offers music streaming capabilities,
  allowing you to stream your music to your preferred player, control it with
  Localplay, or directly listen on the web page with the HTML5 player. The app
  is completely free and open source, and it's designed to work on almost any
  internet-enabled device, including your phone, tablet, or television. Ampache
  is not a media organizer, but a tool that presents an already organized
  collection in a useful way.
