name: ScyllaDB
description:
  ScyllaDB is a distributed NoSQL database that is compatible with Apache
  Cassandra but offers superior performance and lower latency. It's designed to
  handle high-throughput, low-latency workloads with linear scalability.
  ScyllaDB is written in C++ and uses a shared-nothing architecture, making it
  highly efficient for modern hardware. It's particularly well-suited for
  applications requiring high availability, consistent performance, and massive
  scalability.

instructions:
  Once the server is up, you can connect to ScyllaDB using the following ports
  9042 - Native transport (CQL) 9160 - Thrift transport 7000 - Inter-node
  communication 7001 - SSL inter-node communication 10000 - REST API
