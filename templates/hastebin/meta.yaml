name: Hastebin
description:
  Haste is an open-source software that allows you to quickly and easily share
  text snippets. It's designed to be simple, pretty, and easy to use. With
  Haste, you can create a 'paste' of your text and it will generate a unique URL
  that you can share. This is particularly useful for sharing code snippets or
  other information that you want to quickly share with others. Haste is written
  in node.js and can be backed by either a file system or redis, providing
  flexibility in how it's set up. It also includes a utility called haste-client
  that allows you to create pastes directly from your command line. Haste is
  designed to work well with a variety of browsers, including Firefox, Chrome,
  and Safari.
