name: Duplicati
description:
  Duplicati is a free, open-source backup software designed to store encrypted
  backups online. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. The software
  works with standard protocols like FTP, SSH, WebDAV, and popular services such
  as Backblaze B2, Tardigrade, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon S3, Google Drive,
  box.com, Mega, hubiC, and many others. Duplicati allows you to backup files
  and folders with strong AES-256 encryption, saving space with incremental
  backups and data deduplication. It can run backups on any machine through a
  web-based interface or via command line interface. Duplicati has a built-in
  scheduler and auto-updater, ensuring your backups are always up-to-date. It is
  designed for online backups from scratch, handling network issues efficiently.
  For instance, interrupted backups can be resumed, and Duplicati regularly
  tests the content of backups, detecting broken backups on corrupt storage
  systems before itâ€™s too late. The software is configured by a web interface
  that runs in any browser and can be accessed from anywhere.
