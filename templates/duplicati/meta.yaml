name: Duplicati
description: Duplicati is a free, open-source backup software designed to store
  your encrypted backups online. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and
  Linux. The software works with standard protocols like FTP, SSH, WebDAV and
  popular services like Backblaze B2, Tardigrade, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon S3,
  Google Drive, box.com, Mega, hubiC and many others. Duplicati allows you to
  backup files and folders with strong AES-256 encryption, saving space with
  incremental backups and data deduplication. It can run backups on any machine
  through a web-based interface or via command line interface. Duplicati has a
  built-in scheduler and auto-updater to ensure your backups are always
  up-to-date. It uses strong AES-256 encryption to protect your privacy, and
  it's designed to handle online backups efficiently, even in the face of
  network issues. It can resume interrupted backups and regularly tests the
  content of backups to detect any issues early. Duplicati can be configured
  through a web interface that runs in any browser, even on mobile devices,
  allowing you to access it from anywhere.
