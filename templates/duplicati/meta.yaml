name: Duplicati
description: Duplicati is a free, open-source backup software designed to store
  encrypted backups online. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. The
  software works with standard protocols like FTP, SSH, WebDAV, and popular
  services such as Backblaze B2, Tardigrade, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon S3,
  Google Drive, box.com, Mega, hubiC, and many others. Duplicati allows you to
  backup files and folders with strong AES-256 encryption, saving space with
  incremental backups and data deduplication. It can run backups on any machine
  through a web-based interface or via command line interface. Duplicati has a
  built-in scheduler and auto-updater, ensuring your backups are always
  up-to-date. It is designed for online backups from scratch, handling network
  issues efficiently. For instance, interrupted backups can be resumed, and
  Duplicati regularly tests the content of backups, detecting broken backups on
  corrupt storage systems before it’s too late. The software is configured by a
  web interface that runs in any browser and can be accessed from anywhere.
