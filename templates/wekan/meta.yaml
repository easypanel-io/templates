  WeKan is an open-source, customizable, and privacy-focused Kanban app designed
  for efficient task management. It allows you to create multiple boards for
  different projects or tasks, with each board having columns to represent
  different stages of your work such as 'To Do', 'Doing', and 'Done'. You can
  add cards to each board to represent tasks, complete with titles,
  descriptions, and due dates. WeKan uses lists on a Kanban board to represent
  different stages of a workflow, helping you organize and track tasks. You can
  customize lists by changing their color or adding custom fields to capture
  more information about tasks. A card in WeKan represents a task on a Kanban
  board, including a title, description, due date, labels, and comments. As work
  progresses, you can move the card from one column to another. WeKan also
  offers several features to protect your data, including a self-hosting option,
  access controls, and open-source code for security auditing. It is designed
  with security in mind, and its features and options are built to help you
  protect your data and keep it secure.
