name: Soulbeet
description:
  Soulbeet is a self-hosted music management and downloading application that
  integrates with slskd (Soulseek daemon) and beets to create a seamless music
  acquisition and organization workflow. The application provides a web
  interface for searching and downloading music through the Soulseek
  peer-to-peer network, then automatically organizing your downloads using
  beets' powerful music library management capabilities. Soulbeet connects to
  your slskd instance to handle the actual Soulseek network communication,
  allowing you to search for tracks, browse user shares, and queue downloads.
  Once files are downloaded, beets integration enables automatic tagging,
  metadata correction, album art fetching, and file organization based on your
  configured rules. The application uses SQLite for lightweight data persistence
  and supports custom beets configurations for advanced music library
  management. Perfect for music enthusiasts who want to build and maintain a
  well-organized digital music collection, users looking for a self-hosted
  alternative to music streaming services, audiophiles who prefer to own their
  music with proper metadata and organization, or anyone who wants to combine
  the power of Soulseek's peer-to-peer network with beets' music library
  management in a single unified interface.
