name: InfluxDB
description:
  InfluxDB is a time-series database designed to handle high write and query
  loads commonly required for real-time analytics. It’s optimized for storing
  timestamped data, making it ideal for monitoring metrics, tracking events, and
  handling sensor data. With its efficient storage engine, InfluxDB offers
  built-in support for data compression and compaction, allowing for efficient
  data retention and storage. This database supports SQL-like queries through
  InfluxQL, integrates seamlessly with popular data visualization tools like
  Grafana, and can handle data from IoT devices, DevOps monitoring, finance, and
  more.
