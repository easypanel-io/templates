name: Matrix Synapse
description: Matrix is an open network designed for secure, decentralised
  communication. It allows you to chat with friends, family, communities, and
  co-workers, providing a cozy, safe, and supercharged environment for your
  conversations. Matrix is not just a communication platform, but also a rich
  ecosystem that enables you to build advanced, rich communication applications.
  It's an open-source project, supported by organisations and individuals who
  care about the health of the ecosystem. Matrix.org, the core team behind
  Matrix, has developed Synapse, a Matrix homeserver implementation, which is
  generously hosted by UpCloud. With Matrix, you can reclaim your space and
  start building your own communication apps.
instructions: To create a user, simply execute the command
  "register_new_matrix_user -c data/homeserver.yaml" via console connection.
