name: DCM
description:
  DCM is a lightweight self-hosted web interface for managing and monitoring
  Docker containers. It provides a simple dashboard to view container status,
  start/stop operations, and inspect basic container details. Designed to be
  minimal and easy to deploy, DCM helps you keep an eye on your containers
  without exposing the full Docker API or using heavier management stacks. Ideal
  for small home labs or users who want a quick overview of their running
  services via a browser.
