name: Photoview
description:
  Photoview is a user-friendly photo gallery designed for photographers. It
  allows you to easily navigate through directories filled with high-resolution
  photos and videos. The app syncs with your file system, automatically
  organizing your media based on the file structure. Directories become albums
  filled with the photos and videos found within them. Photoview also
  automatically rescans for new media, keeping your gallery updated. Multiple
  users can be configured, each with their own directory of photos and videos,
  and each user's media is kept private with a username and password. Albums and
  individual photos or videos can be shared through public or password-protected
  links. Photoview also analyzes photos for EXIF metadata, displaying this
  information next to the photo and using it to present photos on a map. The app
  also has a mobile version for iOS, allowing you to quickly access your media
  library from your phone. Photoview supports RAW images, automatically extracts
  metadata from images and videos, and optimizes videos for the web. It also
  generates thumbnails automatically and ensures that your media is secure and
  private.
instructions:
  You will need to mount the location where your photos are to complete the
  installation.

benefits:
  - title: Easy Media Organization
    description:
      Photoview allows you to easily organize your media files. It automatically
      scans your file system for media and organizes them based on the file
      structure. Directories become albums populated with the photos and videos
      found inside.
  - title: User Privacy
    description:
      Photoview ensures user privacy by allowing each user to have their own
      directory of photos and videos. Each user is configured with a username
      and password, keeping their media private.

      With the official iOS app, you can quickly access your entire media
      library from your phone. Navigate, share, and download photos and videos
      directly within the app.

      used to automatically present the photos on a map.
