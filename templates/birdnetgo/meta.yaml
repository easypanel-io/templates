name: BirdNET-Go
description:
  BirdNET-Go is a real-time bird sound identification and monitoring system that
  uses advanced AI and machine learning to recognize bird species from audio
  recordings. It analyzes ambient sounds from microphones or audio files to
  identify and catalog bird species in your area. BirdNET-Go features automatic
  species detection with confidence scoring, location-based range filtering to
  show only birds likely in your region, real-time audio streaming, and
  comprehensive logging of all detected species. The application supports custom
  sensitivity settings, overlap detection for better accuracy, and can utilize
  XNNPACK acceleration for improved performance. Perfect for bird enthusiasts,
  ornithologists, researchers, and anyone interested in monitoring local bird
  populations and creating automated bird sound databases.
