name: Node-RED
description:
  Node-RED is a unique programming tool designed for creating event-driven
  applications in a low-code environment. It allows you to connect hardware
  devices, APIs, and online services in innovative ways. The app features a
  browser-based editor that simplifies the process of creating flows using a
  wide array of nodes available in the palette. These flows can be deployed to
  its runtime with just a single click. Node-RED also allows you to create
  JavaScript functions within the editor using a rich text editor and save
  useful functions, templates, or flows for future use. Built on Node.js,
  Node-RED is lightweight and can run on low-cost hardware like Raspberry Pi or
  in the cloud. It also supports the import and export of flows in JSON format
  for easy sharing.
