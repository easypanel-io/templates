description:
  WireGuard Easy is an all-in-one application designed to simplify the
  installation and management of WireGuard on any Linux host. With a
  user-friendly web interface, it allows you to list, create, edit, delete,
  enable, and disable clients with ease. You can also view a client's QR code
  and download a client's configuration file directly from the app. The app
  provides statistics on which clients are connected and features Tx/Rx charts
  for each connected client. It also supports Gravatar. WireGuard Easy requires
  a host with a kernel that supports WireGuard and Docker installed.
