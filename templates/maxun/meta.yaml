name: Maxun
description:
  Maxun is a self-hosted data automation platform that combines a modern
  frontend with a backend capable of browser automation (Playwright), file
  storage via MinIO, and PostgreSQL persistence. It lets you run data collection
  and integration workflows with headless Chromium, store assets in
  S3-compatible storage, and manage everything from a web interface. Ideal for
  teams who need a self-hosted automation stack with database, object storage,
  and browser automation included.
