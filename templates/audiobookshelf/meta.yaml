name: Audiobookshelf
description:
  Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted server designed to manage and play your
  audiobooks and podcasts. It works best when you have an organized directory
  structure, as it takes information from your folder names, including the
  author name, series name, book title, publish year, series sequence, and
  subtitle. The app uses the ID3 metadata tags in audio files to populate data,
  and it supports the same configuration options you would pass to a Docker
  container. Audiobookshelf is designed to be deployed on your own server using
  Easypanel, a modern server control panel. With Audiobookshelf, you can enjoy
  your favorite audiobooks and podcasts in a well-organized and easily
  accessible manner.
instructions:
  Starter Host Path will be bind to "/audiobooks" inside the container. You can
  bind any other directories you want to use for your book and podcast
  collections.

benefits:
  - title: Self-Hosted Audiobook and Podcast Server
    description:
      Audiobookshelf allows you to host your own audiobook and podcast server.
      This means you can have all your favorite audiobooks and podcasts in one
      place, accessible from anywhere. No more switching between different
      platforms or apps to listen to your favorite content.
  - title: Organized Directory Structure
    description:
      Audiobookshelf works best when you have an organized directory structure.
      It takes information from your folder names, including the author name,
      series name, book title, publish year, series sequence, and subtitle. This
      makes it easy to find and manage your audiobooks and podcasts.
  - title: Metadata Extraction
    description:
      Audiobookshelf uses the ID3 metadata tags in audio files to populate data.
      This includes details like artist, album, subtitle, publisher, year,
      composer, description, genre, series, series-part, language, isbn, and
      asin. This ensures that all your content is accurately labeled and easy to
      search.
features:
  - title: Audio Tracks
    description:
      An audiobook in Audiobookshelf contains tracks. Tracks are audio files
      assigned a track number. The track number is parsed from the audio
      filename and from the ID3 tags of the audio file. This allows for easy
      navigation within an audiobook.
  - title: Additional Metadata
    description:
      Audiobookshelf allows for additional metadata to be added. If you have a
      file named desc.txt in the library item folder it will be used as the
      description. If you have a file named reader.txt in the library item
      folder it will be used as the narrator. If you have an OPF file with
      extension .opf in the library item folder it will be parsed.
  - title: Directory Structure for Podcasts
    description:
      Audiobookshelf supports a specific directory structure for podcasts. This
      makes it easy to organize and manage your podcasts, ensuring that each
      episode is easy to find and play.
