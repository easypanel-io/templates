name: Audiobookshelf
description: Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server that
  allows you to manage and play your audiobooks and podcasts. It works best when
  you have an organized directory structure, as it takes information from your
  folder names, including the author name, series name, book title, publish
  year, series sequence, and subtitle. You can also enable scanner settings to
  prefer using your audio file ID3 tags or an OPF file over using folder names.
  The app uses the ID3 metadata tags in audio files to populate data and
  contains tracks, which are audio files assigned a track number. The track
  number is parsed from the audio filename and from the ID3 tags of the audio
  file. Audiobooks that are made up of multiple discs or CDs will be ordered
  first by disc number then by track number.
instructions: Starter Host Path will be bind to "/audiobooks" inside the
  container. You can bind any other directories you want to use for your book
  and podcast collections.
