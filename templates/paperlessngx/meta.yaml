description:
  Paperless-ngx is a modern document management system designed to convert your
  physical documents into a searchable online archive, helping you maintain a
  clutter-free, paperless environment. It uses advanced OCR technology to add
  selectable text to image-only documents, and allows you to organize and index
  your scanned documents with tags, correspondents, types, and more. The app
  supports a variety of file formats including PDFs, images, plain text files,
  and Office documents. It also features a single-page application front end
  with a dashboard that displays basic statistics and allows document upload.
  With its full-text search functionality, you can easily find the documents you
  need, with results sorted by relevance to your search query. The app also
  includes email processing, enabling it to add documents from your email
  accounts. Moreover, Paperless-ngx is powered by machine learning, enabling it
  to learn from your documents and automatically assign tags, correspondents,
  and types to documents once you've stored a few documents in it. It is
  optimized for multi-core systems, allowing it to process multiple documents in
  parallel.
