name: Kanboard
description: Kanboard is a free and open-source project management software that
  employs the Kanban methodology. It provides a visual and clear overview of
  your tasks, allowing you to easily understand the current status of a project.
  With Kanboard, you can drag and drop tasks to manage your project, limit your
  work in progress to stay focused, and adapt the board to your project by
  adding, renaming, and removing columns. The software also includes a simple
  query language for finding tasks quickly, and allows you to break down tasks
  into sub-tasks, estimate time or complexity, and add comments or documents.
  Kanboard also offers automated actions to streamline your workflow, and is
  translated in over 30 languages.
