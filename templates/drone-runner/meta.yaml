name: Drone Runner
description: Drone is a powerful Continuous Integration platform designed for
  busy development teams. It automates software build and testing, making it a
  vital tool for efficient and effective software development. The platform
  allows for configuration as a code, with pipelines configured using a simple,
  easy-to-read file that you commit to your git repository. Each pipeline step
  is executed inside an isolated Docker container that is automatically
  downloaded at runtime. Drone integrates seamlessly with multiple source code
  management systems, including GitHub, GitHubEnterprise, Bitbucket, and GitLab.
  It supports multiple operating systems and architectures, and works with any
  language, database or service that runs inside a Docker container. You can
  choose from thousands of public Docker images or provide your own. Drone also
  allows for the creation and sharing of plugins, using containers to drop
  pre-configured steps into your pipeline. Advanced customization is made easy
  with Drone, allowing for the implementation of custom access controls,
  approval workflows, secret management, yaml syntax extensions and more. Builds
  are isolated, ensuring no conflicts on shared servers, and the platform scales
  effortlessly. Drone is a comprehensive solution for all your continuous
  integration needs.
