name: Drone Runner
description:
  Drone.io is a self-service Continuous Integration platform designed for busy
  development teams. It automates software build and testing, making it easier
  for teams to manage their development process. The platform allows for
  configuration as a code, with pipelines configured through a simple,
  easy-to-read file committed to your git repository. Each pipeline step is
  executed inside an isolated Docker container that is automatically downloaded
  at runtime. Drone.io integrates seamlessly with multiple source code
  management systems, including GitHub, GitHubEnterprise, Bitbucket, and GitLab.
  It supports multiple operating systems and architectures, and works with any
  language, database, or service that runs inside a Docker container. The
  platform also allows for advanced customization, including custom access
  controls, approval workflows, secret management, and yaml syntax extensions.
  Drone.io ensures that every build runs in an isolated Docker container,
  providing full control and preventing conflicting builds on shared servers.
