name: Jaeger
description:
  Jaeger is an end-to-end distributed tracing system used for monitoring and
  troubleshooting microservices-based architectures. It helps developers track
  requests across complex systems, visualize latencies, and diagnose performance
  issues. Jaeger supports multiple storage backends and provides powerful
  querying and visualization capabilities. It is designed to be scalable and
  production-ready, making it a valuable tool for debugging and optimizing
  distributed applications.
