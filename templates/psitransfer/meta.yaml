  PsiTransfer is a simple, open-source, self-hosted file sharing solution
  designed to provide an alternative to paid services like Dropbox and
  WeTransfer. The app allows for the sharing of many and very large files with
  ease, thanks to its support for streams. It also offers resumable uploads and
  downloads, ensuring you never lose progress. With PsiTransfer, you can set an
  expiry time for your upload bucket, and even offer one-time downloads. The app
  also supports downloading all files as a zip or tar.gz archive, and provides a
  modal-style file preview. For added security, PsiTransfer offers a
  password-protected download list. The app is lightweight and mobile-friendly,
  making it easy to use on any device. It also allows for explicit named bucket
  IDs with a query param sid=<myBucketID>.
