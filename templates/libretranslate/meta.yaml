description:
  LibreTranslate is a free and open-source machine translation app that is

  library. LibreTranslate can translate text between different languages,
  auto-detect the language of the input text, and even handle HTML content. It
  provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input the text they
  want to translate, select the source and target languages, and get the
  translated text. With LibreTranslate, you can enjoy a reliable, accurate, and
  privacy-friendly translation service right at your fingertips.
