name: LibreTranslate
description: LibreTranslate is a free and open-source machine translation app
  that is entirely self-hosted. Unlike other translation apps, it doesn't rely
  on proprietary providers such as Google or Azure to perform translations.
  Instead, its translation engine is powered by the open-source Argos Translate
  library. The app allows you to easily translate text from one language to
  another, with features such as auto-detect language and HTML translation. It
  also provides an API for developers to integrate the translation functionality
  into their own applications. With LibreTranslate, you have full control over
  your translations, ensuring privacy and flexibility.
