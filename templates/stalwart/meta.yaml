name: Stalwart
description:
  Stalwart is a modern, all-in-one mail and collaboration server written in Rust
  for security and performance. It bundles SMTP, IMAP, JMAP, POP3, CalDAV,
  CardDAV, and WebDAV into a single binary with a unified configuration.
  Features include a built-in spam and phishing filter with LLM-driven analysis,
  DMARC/DKIM/SPF/ARC authentication, encryption at rest with S/MIME or OpenPGP,
  automatic TLS via ACME, full-text search in 17 languages, Sieve scripting, and
  a web-based admin dashboard. It supports pluggable storage backends (RocksDB,
  FoundationDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, S3, Redis) and scales from a single
  instance to thousands of nodes with built-in clustering, load balancing, and
  fault tolerance.
instructions:
  On first boot, Stalwart auto-generates admin credentials and prints them to
  the container logs. Check the service logs to find the admin username and
  password. Then access the web admin at the service domain and log in. From
  there, configure your domain under Management > Directory > Domains, and
  Stalwart will generate the required DNS records (MX, DKIM, SPF, DMARC) for
  you. Set the correct server hostname in Settings > Server > Network. Mail
  ports (SMTP 25, submission 587/465, IMAP 143/993, POP3 110/995, ManageSieve
  4190) are exposed for direct access.
