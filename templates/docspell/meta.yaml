  Docspell is a personal document management system designed to archive and
  organize your digital documents. It helps you scan, organize, search, and
  retrieve your documents with ease. Docspell automatically processes documents,
  extracts text via OCR, and makes your documents searchable through full-text
  search powered by Solr. The system consists of multiple components a REST
  server for the web interface, a job executor (joex) for background processing,
  a directory consumer for automatic document ingestion, and Solr for powerful
  search capabilities. Docspell helps you categorize documents, add metadata,
  and efficiently manage your paperwork in a secure, self-hosted environment.
