name: Docker registry
description: The toolset to pack, ship, store, and deliver content. Docker
  Registry is the Open Source Registry implementation for storing and
  distributing container images using the OCI Distribution Specification. The
  goal of this project is to provide a simple, secure, and scalable base for
  building a large scale registry solution or running a simple private registry.
  It is a core library for many registry operators including Docker Hub, GitHub
  Container Registry, GitLab Container Registry and DigitalOcean Container
  Registry, as well as the CNCF Harbor Project, and VMware Harbor Registry.
instructions: The Registry doesn't have a UI. To interact with the registry you
  should use the Docker CLI.
