  flexible software is tailored to your needs, providing clear and accessible
  data for all your team members. It allows for real-time collaboration and easy
  integration with other software. Baserow also supports the creation of custom
  plugins, making it a developer-friendly tool. It is built with modern and
  proven frameworks, such as Django and Nuxt, and works with PostgreSQL. Baserow
  is available as a hosted SaaS offering on the baserow.io website, or you can
  choose to host your own instance on-premise or in the cloud. It offers a free
  plan for those who want to try it out, as well as premium and advanced plans
  for users who want to do more with their data.
