description:
  Tunarr is a modern IPTV server that creates custom TV channels from your
  personal media library. It automatically generates continuous programming
  schedules using your movies, TV shows, and other content, creating an
  authentic TV viewing experience. Tunarr provides intelligent scheduling,
  program guide generation, and seamless integration with popular media
  libraries like Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby. Perfect for home entertainment
  setups, it transforms your digital media collection into personalized TV
  channels that can be watched on any IPTV-compatible device or application.

instructions:
  After deployment, access Tunarr through your domain. The web interface will
  guide you through the initial setup process. You'll need to configure your
  media library connections (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, or local files), set up TV
  channels and programming schedules, and configure your IPTV player to connect
  to the generated M3U playlist. Tunarr will automatically scan your media
  library and create intelligent programming schedules for your custom TV
  channels.
