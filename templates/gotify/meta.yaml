name: Gotify
description: Gotify is a simple, self-hosted server for sending and receiving
  messages. It is designed with a user-friendly interface and a straightforward
  API, making it easy to use across different platforms. The core of Gotify, the
  gotify/server, features a WebUI and functionality for sending messages via a
  REST-API, subscribing/receiving messages via a web socket connection, and
  managing users, clients, and applications. Gotify also includes an Android
  client, gotify/android, which subscribes to the message stream of
  gotify/server and creates push notifications for newly received messages.
  Additionally, there's a command line client, gotify/cli, for pushing messages
  to gotify/server. All these features make Gotify a versatile tool for managing
  and exchanging messages in a secure, self-hosted environment.
