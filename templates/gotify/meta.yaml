description:
  Gotify is a simple, self-hosted server for sending and receiving messages. It
  is designed with a user-friendly interface and a straightforward API, making
  it easy to use across different platforms. The core of Gotify is the server,
  which features a WebUI and functionality for sending messages via a REST-API,
  subscribing/receiving messages via a web socket connection, and managing
  users, clients, and applications. Gotify also includes an Android client for
  subscribing to the message stream of the server, creating push notifications
  for newly received messages. Additionally, there is a command line client for
  pushing messages to the server. All these features make Gotify a versatile
  tool for managing and exchanging messages while maintaining control over your
  data.
