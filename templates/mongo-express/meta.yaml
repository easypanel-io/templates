name: Mongo Express
description:
  mongo-express is a web-based MongoDB admin interface designed with Node.js,
  Express, and Bootstrap3. It allows you to connect to multiple databases, view,
  add, delete databases, and manage collections. You can also view, add, update,
  and delete documents within these collections. The app supports previewing
  audio, video, and image assets inline in the collection view. Large or nested
  objects are collapsible for easy overview, and big document properties are
  loaded on-demand to keep the collection view fast. The app also supports
  GridFS, enabling you to add, get, and delete incredibly large files. It uses
  BSON data types in documents and is mobile responsive, thanks to Bootstrap 3.
  The app also supports connection and authentication to individual databases,
  as well as admin authentication to view all databases. It includes features
  for database blacklist/whitelist, custom CA, and CA validation disabling, and
  supports replica sets.
