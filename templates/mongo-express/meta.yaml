name: Mongo Express
description: Mongo-Express is a web-based MongoDB admin interface created with
  Node.js, Express, and Bootstrap3. This app allows you to connect to multiple
  databases, view, add, delete databases, and manage collections. You can view,
  add, update, and delete documents within these collections. It also supports
  previewing audio, video, and image assets inline in the collection view. Large
  or nested objects are collapsible for an easy overview, and it supports
  on-demand loading of large document properties to keep the collection view
  fast. The app also supports GridFS, allowing you to add, get, and delete
  incredibly large files. It uses BSON data types in documents and is
  mobile-responsive, making it usable on small screens. The app also supports
  connection and authentication to individual databases, as well as admin
  authentication to view all databases. It also allows for database
  blacklist/whitelist, custom CA and CA validation disabling, and supports
  replica sets.
