name: Opera
description:
  Opera is a multi-platform web browser developed by Opera. This app is based on
  Chromium, but sets itself apart from other Chromium-based browsers through its
  unique user interface and additional features. The app can be accessed at
  http://yourhost:3000/ or https://yourhost:3001/. It provides a true lossless
  image at a high frame rate to your web browser by changing the Stream Quality
  preset to 'Lossless'. The app also allows you to specify one or multiple
  Chromium CLI flags, which will be passed to the application in full. This app
  is designed to avoid permission issues that can arise between the host OS and
  the container by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID.
instructions:
  use abc:abc to login. To access the login interface, add ?login=true to your
  URL.
