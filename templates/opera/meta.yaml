name: Opera
description: Opera is a multi-platform web browser developed by Opera. This app
  is based on Chromium, but sets itself apart from other Chromium-based browsers
  through its unique user interface and additional features. The app can be
  accessed at http://yourhost:3000/ or https://yourhost:3001/. It provides a
  true lossless image at a high frame rate to your web browser by changing the
  Stream Quality preset to 'Lossless'. The app also allows you to specify one or
  multiple Chromium CLI flags, which will be passed to the application in full.
  This app is designed to avoid permission issues that can arise between the
  host OS and the container by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group
  PGID.
instructions: use abc:abc to login. To access the login interface, add
  ?login=true to your URL.
