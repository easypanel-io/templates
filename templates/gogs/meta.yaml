name: Gogs
description: Gogs is a self-hosted Git service designed to be simple, stable,
  and extensible. It provides a painless way to set up your own Git service with
  an independent binary distribution across all platforms that Go supports,
  including Linux, macOS, Windows, and ARM-based systems. Gogs is lightweight
  and has low minimal requirements, making it possible to run even on an
  inexpensive Raspberry Pi. The app allows access to repositories via SSH, HTTP,
  and HTTPS protocols and offers features such as user, organization, and
  repository management, repository webhooks, Git hooks, deploy keys, Git LFS,
  repository issues, pull requests, wiki, protected branches, and collaboration.
  It also supports migrating and mirroring repositories with wiki from other
  code hosts and provides a web editor for quick editing of repository files and
  wiki. Gogs is 100% open source and free of charge.
