name: Mailhog
description: MailHog is a versatile email testing tool designed for developers.
  It allows you to configure your application to use MailHog for SMTP delivery,
  enabling you to view your outgoing emails in a user-friendly web UI. You can
  also retrieve these messages with the JSON API. The app provides the option to
  release messages to real SMTP servers for delivery. MailHog is built with Go,
  making it lightweight and portable, and it runs without installation on
  multiple platforms. It supports various features such as real-time updates
  using EventSource, HTTP basic authentication for MailHog UI and API, multipart
  MIME support, and in-memory message storage. It also offers MongoDB and
  file-based storage for message persistence. Additionally, MailHog includes a
  Chaos Monkey for failure testing and a sendmail replacement that redirects
  mail to MailHog using SMTP.
