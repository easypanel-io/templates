name: Pterodactyl Panel with Blueprint Framework
description:
  Pterodactyl Panel enhanced with the Blueprint Framework — an advanced
  extension system that enhances the game server management experience. Please
  note Blueprint is not official or affiliated with Pterodactyl Panel. It is an
  independent framework for creating and managing extensions, allowing you to
  customize the panel with themes, add-ons, and advanced features. This template
  offers a complete installation of Pterodactyl Panel with Blueprint already
  configured, providing access to a wide variety of extensions created by the
  community. With Blueprint, you can easily install themes, dashboard widgets,
  administrative tools, and custom features. Ideal for hosting providers, gaming
  communities, and administrators who want to extend the panel's capabilities
  with advanced configuration options and custom database naming.
instructions:
  After installation, access the console and run "php artisan p:user:make" to
  create an admin user. Blueprint extensions can be installed via the admin
  panel or using the "blueprint -install" command. Visit the Blueprint
  marketplace to discover available themes and extensions. You can customize the
  database name during setup for better organization and management.
