name: Hasura
description: Hasura is a powerful Data API Platform that automates the process
  of building, securing, optimizing, and deploying GraphQL and REST APIs. It
  enables developers to generate APIs effortlessly by connecting to existing
  databases, eliminating the need for manual API creation and enabling rapid,
  scalable application development. Hasura is compatible with a variety of
  popular databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, allowing you to
  build GraphQL APIs on top of your existing databases without having to switch
  to a new one. With Hasura, you can accelerate the development of new
  applications or add new features to an existing application in days instead of
  weeks. It also helps in fast-tracking cloud migration, frontend and backend
  modernization, and application re-architecture projects by automating 80% of
  your API development work. Hasura also provides comprehensive tools to secure
  APIs beyond authentication and authorization, and offers precision insights
  for optimal availability and performance of your APIs.
