name: Hasura
description:
  Hasura is a powerful Data API Platform that automates the process of building,
  securing, optimizing, and deploying GraphQL and REST APIs. It eliminates the
  need for manual API creation, enabling developers to generate APIs
  effortlessly by connecting to existing databases. This results in rapid,
  scalable application development. Hasura is compatible with a variety of
  popular databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, allowing you to
  build GraphQL APIs on top of your existing databases. It also provides
  comprehensive tools to secure APIs beyond authentication and authorization.
  With Hasura, you can accelerate the development of new applications or add new
  features to an existing application in days instead of weeks. It also helps in
  fast-tracking cloud migration, frontend and backend modernization, and
  application re-architecture projects by automating 80% of your API development
  work.
