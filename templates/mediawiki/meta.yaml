  completed, a file named "LocalSettings.php" will be downloaded. Open
  EasyPanel, navigate to the Storage section for MediaWiki, and create a file
  mount. Paste the content of the LocalSettings.php file into the mount and set
  its mount path to /var/www/html/LocalSettings.php. Finally, redeploy the
