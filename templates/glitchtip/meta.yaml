name: GlitchTip
description: GlitchTip is a simple, open-source error tracking application
  designed to collect and organize every error from your project in real time.
  It allows you to report your website or application's exceptions, log
  messages, Content Security Policy violations, and more to one place for easy
  triage and resolution. GlitchTip also offers Application Performance
  Monitoring to identify where your app is slow, pinpointing your slowest web
  requests, database calls, and other transactions. Additionally, it provides
  Uptime Monitoring, pinging your site and alerting you when it's not
  responding. GlitchTip is compatible with Sentry client SDKs, and offers the
  freedom of open source, allowing you to view, modify, and use the code as you
  see fit. It can be run on your server or hosted for you, with a range of
  subscription options to suit your needs.
