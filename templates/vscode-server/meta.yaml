name: Visual Studio Code Server
description:
  The LinuxServer.io team presents the docker-code-server, a powerful tool that
  allows you to run VS Code on a remote server, accessible through your browser.
  This means you can code on your Chromebook, tablet, and laptop with a
  consistent development environment. If you're using a Windows or Mac
  workstation, you can more easily develop for Linux. The app also allows you to
  leverage large cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and
  more. It helps preserve battery life when you're on the go, as all intensive
  computation runs on your server, eliminating the need for running excess
  instances of Chrome.
