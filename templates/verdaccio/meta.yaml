name: Verdaccio
description:
  Verdaccio is a lightweight, private npm proxy registry built in Node.js,
  designed to simplify and enhance your development workflow. It provides a
  simple, zero-configuration-required local private NPM registry, eliminating
  the need for a full database to get started. Verdaccio comes equipped with its
  own compact database and the capability to proxy other registries, such as
  npmjs.org, while caching the downloaded modules for improved efficiency. It
  allows you to use all the benefits of the npm package system in your company
  without exposing all your code to the public. You can link multiple
  registries, fetch packages from multiple sources in a single project, and even
  publish locally modified versions of third-party packages. Verdaccio is
  compatible with popular npm clients like npm, yarn, and pnpm, and supports
  various plugins for extended storage capabilities.
