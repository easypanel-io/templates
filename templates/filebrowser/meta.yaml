description: File Browser is a powerful, standalone application designed to
  provide a file managing interface within a specified directory. It offers a
  range of features, including the ability to upload, delete, preview, rename,
  and edit your files. The app also supports the creation of multiple users,
  with each user having their own directory. In addition to these, File Browser
  offers customization options such as changing its name, adding a global custom
  style sheet, and using your own logotype. It also has a unique feature called
  'Command Runner' that allows you to execute any shell command before or after
  a certain event. Whether you're managing personal files or coordinating a
  team, File Browser offers a streamlined, user-friendly solution.
