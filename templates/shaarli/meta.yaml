description:
  Shaarli is a personal, minimalist, super-fast, and database-free bookmarking
  service. It allows you to manage and share the links you discover, making it
  an ideal tool for those who frequently come across interesting content on the
  web. With Shaarli, you can share, comment, and save links, use it as a minimal
  blog or writing platform, or even as a read-it-later/todo list. It also serves
  as a notepad for drafting and saving articles, posts, or ideas, and a
  knowledge base for keeping notes, documentation, and code snippets. You can
  edit, view, and search your links, organize them with tags, and even generate
  ATOM and RSS feeds. Shaarli is self-hosted, meaning you install it on your own
  server, ensuring your data remains yours. It's an excellent alternative to
  commercial services, and it's free and open-source.
