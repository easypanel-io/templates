description:
  Wishlist is a self-hosted gift registry and wishlist management application
  that simplifies gift-giving for families, friends, and special occasions. It
  provides a centralized platform where users can create and share wishlists,
  claim items to prevent duplicate gifts, and track purchase status. The
  application features automatic product data fetching from URLs, user-friendly
  interfaces accessible to all ages, and support for multiple groups to separate
  different circles like family, friends, or coworkers. Wishlist includes
  registry mode for wedding registries or single comprehensive lists, item
  claiming with privacy to prevent gift spoilers, purchase tracking for claimed
  items, gift suggestions from friends and family, and user invitation via email
  with SMTP integration. Built with a modern web interface and Progressive Web
  App support, Wishlist offers seamless access across devices with offline
  capabilities. The application uses SQLite for lightweight data storage and
  stores user-uploaded images locally, ensuring all data remains on your
  infrastructure. With OAuth authentication support and customizable token
  expiration, Wishlist provides secure access control while maintaining ease of
  use. Perfect for families coordinating holidays and birthdays, couples
  managing wedding registries, friend groups organizing gift exchanges, or
  anyone who wants a private alternative to public wishlist services with
  complete control over their data and privacy.
