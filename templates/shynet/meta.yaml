description: Shynet is a powerful, open-source analytics tool designed to
  provide you with clear, comprehensive insights about your website's traffic
  and user behavior. Unlike traditional analytics platforms, Shynet respects
  user privacy and does not track individual users across websites. Instead, it
  focuses on providing aggregate data and trends, helping you understand how
  users interact with your website as a whole. Shynet offers a range of features
  including real-time analytics, session tracking, and primary key integration.
  It also supports single-page applications, ensuring you get accurate data even
  when users navigate between pages within your application. With Shynet, you
  can easily create and manage multiple services, each with its own unique
  tracking script. The app also offers an API, allowing you to access all the
  information displayed on the dashboard programmatically. Whether you're a
  small business owner, a web developer, or a data analyst, Shynet provides you
  with the tools you need to make informed decisions about your website.
