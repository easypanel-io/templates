  Shynet is a powerful, open-source analytics tool designed to provide you with
  clear, comprehensive insights about your website's traffic and user behavior.
  Unlike traditional analytics platforms, Shynet respects user privacy and does
  not track individual users across websites. Instead, it focuses on providing
  aggregate data and trends, helping you understand how users interact with your
  website as a whole. Shynet offers a range of features including real-time
  analytics, session tracking, and primary key integration. It also supports
  single-page applications, ensuring you get accurate data even when users
  navigate between pages within your application. With Shynet, you can easily
  create and manage multiple services, each with its own unique tracking script.
  The app also offers an API, allowing you to access all the information
  displayed on the dashboard programmatically. Whether you're a small business
  owner, a web developer, or a data analyst, Shynet provides you with the tools
  you need to make informed decisions about your website.
