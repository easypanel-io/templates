name: SoulSync
description:
  SoulSync is an automated music synchronization service that bridges the gap
  between streaming platforms and your local media library. It automatically
  syncs your Spotify and Tidal playlists to your self-hosted media servers like
  Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome by downloading tracks from Soulseek. The
  web-based interface provides a centralized dashboard for managing playlist
  synchronization, monitoring download progress, configuring OAuth connections
  with streaming services, and organizing your music collection. With automated
  discovery and intelligent matching algorithms, SoulSync ensures your local
  library stays up-to-date with your streaming playlists without manual
  intervention. The service handles the complete workflow from playlist
  detection through download orchestration to media server integration, making
  it effortless to maintain an offline music collection that mirrors your online
  listening habits. Perfect for music enthusiasts who want the convenience of
  streaming services combined with the reliability and ownership of local media
  files, audiophiles building high-quality music collections, or users preparing
  for offline listening scenarios while maintaining synchronization with their
  curated playlists.
