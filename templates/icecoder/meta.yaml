name: ICEcoder
description: ICEcoder is a revolutionary browser-based code editor designed to
  streamline the process of building websites. It allows you to code directly
  within your web browser, either online or offline, eliminating the need for
  multiple programs. With ICEcoder, you can develop sites and test them on
  actual web servers, making the development process faster and more efficient.
  After development, maintaining your website is a breeze. The app is web-based,
  meaning you can access it from any internet-enabled computer with a modern
  browser. It also doubles as a desktop code editor, compatible with PHP 7.0+,
  and can be used on Linux, PC via WAMP or XAMPP, and Mac via MAMP. Despite its
  simplicity, ICEcoder is packed with features and plugins to enhance your
  coding experience. These include multiple cursors, 80+ highlighting themes,
  find & replace builder, login security, coding assist tools like Emmet, visual
  code diff, code hints, and easy database management with the Adminer plugin.
  The latest version, ICEcoder 8.1, introduces new features like regex search on
  find and replace, double click tab to collapse file manager, and more.
