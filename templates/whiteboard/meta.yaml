description:
  Whiteboard is a lightweight, NodeJS-based collaborative sketchboard that can
  be easily customized to your needs. It allows multiple users to draw and write
  together in real-time, with each user's cursor visible to others. The app
  provides a range of features including the ability to undo and redo actions,
  drag and drop or copy and paste images or PDFs, resize, move, rotate and draw
  images, write text and sticky notes, and save the whiteboard to an image or
  JSON. You can also draw angle lines and squares by pressing 'Shift' while
  drawing. The app is compatible with PC, tablet, and mobile devices, and can be
  used in various projects such as WebRTC conference tools and online
  collaboration learning activities.
