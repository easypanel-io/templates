description:
  Sourcegraph is a universal code search and intelligence platform designed to
  help developers find, explore, and understand code across all repositories. It
  enables teams to improve productivity and code quality by providing a
  centralized interface for searching, navigating, and understanding codebases.
  Sourcegraph supports multiple version control systems, languages, and
  integrations, making it a powerful tool for developers, DevOps, and
  enterprises. With features like code insights, precise code navigation, and
  batch changes, Sourcegraph enhances collaboration and streamlines development
  workflows.
instructions:
  Once the server is ready (logo is displayed in the terminal), navigate to the
  hostname or IP address on port 7080. Create the admin account, then you'll be
  guided through setting up Sourcegraph for code searching and navigation.
