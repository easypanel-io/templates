name: Cusdis
description: Cusdis is a lightweight, open-source comment system designed with
  privacy at its core. It's a simple and efficient alternative to Disqus, with a
  focus on ease of use and integration. The app is embedded into your website
  with a JS SDK that is only around 5kb, and it comes with built-in
  internationalization and dark mode. When a new comment is posted, you receive
  an email notification and can quickly approve or reply to the comment without
  needing to log in to a dashboard. Cusdis also allows you to set a Webhook URL
  that will be triggered when your website receives a new comment, enabling you
  to integrate it with your favorite tools such as Telegram. The app is free to
  use, with the option of self-hosting or using the cloud service. The cloud
  service offers a free tier for one site with 100 approved comments per month
  and 10 quick approvals per month, and a pro tier for unlimited sites,
  comments, and quick approvals at $5 per month.
