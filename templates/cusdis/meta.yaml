  Cusdis is a lightweight, open-source comment system designed with privacy as a
  priority. It serves as an alternative to Disqus, offering a simple and
  user-friendly way to integrate a comment system into your existing website.
  The app is incredibly lightweight, with the JS SDK embedded to your website
  being only around 5kb. It features built-in i18n and dark-mode for a seamless
  user experience. Cusdis ensures you stay updated with new comments through
  email notifications, and allows for quick approval of comments directly from
  the notification email or webhook. You can also set a webhook URL that
  triggers when your website receives a new comment, allowing you to integrate
  Cusdis with your favorite tools such as Telegram. The app offers flexibility
  with its pricing, providing a free self-hosting option, a free cloud option
  with limited features, and a Cloud Pro option for unlimited access.
