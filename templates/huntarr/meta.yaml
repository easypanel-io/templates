name: Huntarr
description:
  Huntarr is an automated media library enhancement tool that continuously
  monitors and improves your Radarr, Sonarr, and Lidarr collections. It works by
  periodically scanning your media libraries to identify missing items, failed
  downloads, and opportunities for quality upgrades, then automatically
  triggering searches to fill gaps and improve your collection. Huntarr acts as
  an intelligent automation layer on top of your existing *arr stack, ensuring
  your media library stays complete and up-to-date without manual intervention.
  The application features configurable scan intervals, customizable search
  triggers, support for multiple quality profiles, and detailed logging for
  tracking improvements. With its set-it-and-forget-it approach, Huntarr
  continuously works in the background to enhance your media collection by
  finding better quality versions, locating missing episodes or movies, and
  automatically requesting upgrades based on your configured quality
  preferences. The web interface provides visibility into scan history, search
  statistics, and library health metrics. Perfect for users who want their media
  libraries to automatically improve over time, home media server enthusiasts
  managing large collections, or anyone running Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr who wants
  to ensure their libraries are always complete and optimized without constant
  manual searching.
