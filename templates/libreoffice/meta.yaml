      anywhere. This flexibility allows you to stay productive no matter where
      you are.
features:
  - title: Customizable Environment Variables
    description:
      LibreOffice offers a range of environment variables that you can customize
      to suit your needs. These include the internal port the container listens
      on, HTTP Basic auth username and password, the home directory for the file
      manager, and more.
  - title: Optional Run Configurations
    description:
      The app provides optional run configurations, including the ability to
      start a Docker in Docker setup inside the container, mount a GPU into the
      container for GPU accelerated applications, and deliver a true lossless
      image at a high framerate to your web browser.
  - title: User / Group Identifiers
    description:
      When using volumes, you can specify the user PUID and group PGID to avoid
      permissions issues between the host OS and the container. This ensures
      that any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you
      specify.
