name: Weaviate
description:
  Weaviate is an open-source vector database that allows you to store and
  retrieve data objects based on their semantic properties by indexing them with
  vectors. It can be used stand-alone or with a variety of modules that can do
  the vectorization for you and extend the core capabilities. Weaviate provides
  a lightning-fast pure vector similarity search over raw vectors or data
  objects, even with filters. It combines keyword-based search with vector
  search techniques for state-of-the-art results. You can also use any
  generative model in combination with your data, for example to do Q&A over
  your dataset. Weaviate's next-gen vector database can power a wide range of
  innovative apps.
