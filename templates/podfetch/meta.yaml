description:
  Podfetch is a self-hosted podcast manager and aggregator that allows you to
  subscribe to, download, and organize your favorite podcasts from a single
  centralized interface. It automatically fetches new episodes from RSS feeds at
  configurable intervals, stores podcast metadata and audio files locally, and
  provides a web-based interface for browsing and managing your podcast library.
  The application features automatic episode downloading, customizable polling
  intervals for checking new content, SQLite database for lightweight data
  management, and organized file storage for podcast episodes. With its built-in
  audio player, you can stream episodes directly from the web interface without
  needing external podcast clients. Podfetch supports multiple podcast
  subscriptions, episode filtering, playback progress tracking, and automatic
  cleanup of old episodes to manage storage. The Rust-based backend ensures
  efficient performance and low resource usage, making it ideal for running on
  home servers or low-powered devices. Perfect for podcast enthusiasts who want
  complete control over their podcast library, users seeking privacy and
  independence from commercial podcast platforms, home lab administrators
  building media server ecosystems, or anyone who wants to archive and organize
  podcast episodes without relying on third-party services or dealing with
  platform-specific limitations.
