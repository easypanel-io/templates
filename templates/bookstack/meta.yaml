name: Bookstack
description: "BookStack is a free and open-source platform designed to simplify
  the organization and storage of information. It provides a user-friendly
  interface with a WYSIWYG page editor, breaking down content into three
  easy-to-understand categories: Books, Chapters, and Pages. The content within
  BookStack is fully searchable, allowing users to search at the book level or
  across all books, chapters, and pages. It also offers the ability to link
  directly to any paragraph, ensuring your documentation remains interconnected.
  BookStack is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor the system to suit
  your specific needs. It includes built-in drawing capabilities for creating
  diagrams within your documentation, supports multiple languages, and offers an
  optional Markdown editor for those who prefer to write in Markdown. The
  platform also features integrated authentication, powerful search and linking
  capabilities, cross-book sorting, page revisions, image management, and a
  comprehensive role and permission system. It also supports multi-factor
  authentication and offers both a light and dark mode for its user interface."
