name: Commento
description: Commento is a comments widget that enhances the interaction on your
  website. It allows your readers to engage in discussions, ask questions, and
  provide feedback without needing to sign up for an account. The widget
  supports markdown formatting, enabling users to add bold, italics, external
  links, quotes, bullet points, and code to their comments. Commento also
  features upvotes and downvotes, allowing readers to highlight comments that
  contribute to the discussion. For important comments, the sticky comments
  feature lets you pin them to the top of the thread. The app also includes
  moderation tools to manage heated threads, remove off-topic comments, and
  enforce timeouts. Additionally, Commento takes care of spam detection, saving
  you from the hassle of dealing with spammers. The widget is easy to add to
  your website, usually taking less than 10 minutes to set up. You can also
  customize the look of the widget to match your website's aesthetic.
