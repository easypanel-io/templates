name: Journiv
description:
  Journiv is a self-hosted journaling and note-taking application designed for
  personal reflection and documentation. The application provides a secure,
  private platform for writing and organizing your thoughts, experiences, and
  memories. Built with a modern web interface, Journiv offers features for
  creating journal entries, organizing content with tags and categories, and
  searching through your journal history. The application uses SQLite for
  lightweight data storage, Redis for caching and background task processing,
  and Celery for asynchronous operations. With support for rich text editing,
  file attachments, and export capabilities, Journiv helps you maintain a
  comprehensive digital journal. The platform prioritizes privacy and data
  ownership, ensuring all your journal entries remain on your own
  infrastructure. Perfect for individuals who want a private journaling
  solution, writers maintaining personal writing projects, users seeking a
  self-hosted alternative to cloud-based note-taking services, or anyone who
  values complete control over their personal reflections and memories.
