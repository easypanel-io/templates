name: Grafana OTEL LGTM
description:
  Grafana OTEL LGTM is an all-in-one OpenTelemetry backend bundled into a single
  Docker image. It includes the OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus for metrics,
  Grafana Loki for logs, Grafana Tempo for traces, Grafana Pyroscope for
  application profiles, and Grafana for unified visualization. The collector
  automatically routes telemetry signals to the correct backend — metrics to
  Prometheus, logs to Loki, traces to Tempo, and profiles to Pyroscope. It works
  out of the box with OpenTelemetry's default settings, so applications
  instrumented with any OpenTelemetry SDK can send data immediately. Optional
  eBPF auto-instrumentation (OBI) can generate traces and RED metrics for
  HTTP/gRPC services with zero code changes.
instructions: |
  After deployment, access the Grafana dashboard via the service domain. 
  Log in with the default credentials: username "admin", password
  "admin". All data sources (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Pyroscope) are
  pre-configured. Point your OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications to the
  OTLP endpoints — port 4317 for gRPC and port 4318 for HTTP. No additional
  configuration is needed; the image works with OpenTelemetry defaults.

benefits:
  - title: Complete Observability in One Container
    description:
      Bundles OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Pyroscope, and
      Grafana into a single image. Deploy a full observability stack in seconds
      with zero configuration.
  - title: Zero-Config OpenTelemetry Backend
    description:
      Works with OpenTelemetry's default settings out of the box. Any
      application instrumented with an OpenTelemetry SDK can send data
      immediately without endpoint configuration.
  - title: Unified Visualization
    description:
      Grafana comes pre-configured with all data sources connected. Explore
      metrics, logs, traces, and profiles from a single dashboard with built-in
      correlation between signals.
  - title: Multi-Language Support
    description:
      Compatible with OpenTelemetry SDKs for Java, Go, Python, .NET, Node.js,
      Ruby, and any language with OTLP support.
features:
  - title: Automatic Signal Routing
    description:
      The OpenTelemetry Collector automatically routes metrics to Prometheus,
      logs to Loki, traces to Tempo, and profiles to Pyroscope without manual
      pipeline configuration.
  - title: OTLP gRPC & HTTP Endpoints
    description:
      Accepts telemetry data on port 4317 (gRPC) and port 4318 (HTTP) using the
      standard OpenTelemetry Protocol for maximum SDK compatibility.
  - title: Application Profiling
    description:
      Grafana Pyroscope captures continuous application profiles for CPU,
      memory, and other runtime metrics to identify performance bottlenecks.
  - title: eBPF Auto-Instrumentation
    description:
      Optional OBI support uses eBPF to automatically generate traces and RED
      metrics for HTTP/gRPC services with zero code changes (Linux kernel 5.8+
      required).
  - title: Persistent Data Storage
    description:
      All components write to a single /data directory. Mount a volume to
      persist metrics, logs, traces, and profiles across container restarts.
  - title: Configurable Logging
    description:
      Enable debug logging for individual components (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus,
      Tempo, Pyroscope, OTel Collector) or all at once via environment
      variables.
