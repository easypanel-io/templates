description:
  Hasty Paste is a fast and minimalistic app designed for quickly pasting and
  sharing text. It is primarily used for sharing debug logs and similar content
  to aid developers in providing tech support. The app is publicly accessible
  with no authentication required. It generates random IDs for each paste, with
  an optional 'long' ID to reduce the chances of brute force attacks. Users can
  also add expiring pastes. The app features a dark theme and optional syntax
  highlighting. It is designed to use minimal resources and does not require
  JavaScript. Hasty Paste also allows users to choose their file system and
  offers a custom flat-file system. The app is named 'Hasty Paste' to reflect
  its speed and ease of use.
