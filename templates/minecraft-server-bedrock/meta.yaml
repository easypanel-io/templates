  Minecraft Server experience for the Bedrock Edition. It automatically
  downloads the latest stable version of the Minecraft server at startup,
  ensuring you're always up-to-date with the game's latest features and
  improvements. The app also allows you to run or upgrade to any specific
  version or the latest snapshot, giving you full control over your gaming
  experience. If you're using Minecraft clients on consoles, mobile, or native
  Windows, the app offers a dedicated Bedrock Server for optimal performance.
