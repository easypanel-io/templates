description: Mealie is a self-hosted recipe manager and meal planner designed to
  enhance your cooking experience. It features a RestAPI backend and a reactive
  frontend application built in Vue, ensuring a pleasant user experience for the
  whole family. With Mealie, you can quickly and easily import recipes from
  various sites around the web using the built-in recipe scraper. The app also
  provides automatic backups to keep your data safe. The rich user interface
  allows you to create, edit, and delete recipes with ease, and the recipe
  editor supports markdown syntax for added convenience. Mealie also allows you
  to create meal plans for the week, month, or year. You can add new users, sort
  them into groups to share recipes and meal plans, and schedule webhooks to
  send notifications to 3rd party services with today's meal plan data. The open
  API gives you full control of the backend server with interactive
  documentation.
