name: Cronicle
description:
  Cronicle is a powerful, multi-server task scheduler and runner, with an
  easy-to-use web-based interface. It allows you to schedule and run scripts,
  commands, or software programs on a recurring basis, similar to cron jobs but
  with the added capability of visual management and log tracking. Cronicle
  supports complex workflows including dependencies between tasks, and it can
  distribute tasks across multiple servers for load balancing. It's ideal for
  automating backups, updates, data processing tasks, and more in a distributed
  environment.
