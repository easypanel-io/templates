  Tautulli is a powerful web application designed to monitor, analyze, and
  notify you about your Plex Media Server's activities. It runs alongside your
  Plex Media Server, tracking a variety of statistics including what has been
  watched, who watched it, when and where it was watched, and how it was
  watched. The app presents all these statistics in a clean, user-friendly
  interface with tables and graphs. Tautulli also allows you to monitor current
  activity on your Plex Media Server, log watch history for all your users, view
  streaming trends with intuitive graphs, trigger notifications or scripts from
  events on your Plex server, and keep track of when content is added to your
  Plex library. You can also create and send newsletters for recently added
  media, view and delete all synced content from your server, see detailed
  information on all of your media, and even download the official app to view
  activity and stats on the go. Tautulli is compatible with any system that
