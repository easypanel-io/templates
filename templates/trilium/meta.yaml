name: Trilium Notes
description:
  Trilium is a hierarchical note-taking application designed for creating and
  managing large personal knowledge bases. With Trilium, you can arrange your
  notes into an arbitrarily deep tree structure, with the ability to place a
  single note in multiple locations. The app offers rich WYSIWYG note editing,
  including tables, images, and math, with markdown autoformat. It also supports
  editing notes with source code, complete with syntax highlighting. Trilium
  provides seamless note versioning and attributes for note organization,
  querying, and advanced scripting. The app also includes a synchronization
  feature with a self-hosted sync server. For enhanced security, Trilium offers
  strong note encryption with per-note granularity. Other features include
  sketching diagrams with built-in Excalidraw, visualizing notes and their
  relations with relation maps and link maps, and a REST API for automation.
  Trilium is optimized for both usability and performance, capable of handling
  upwards of 100,000 notes.
