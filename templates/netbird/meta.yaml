name: NetBird
description:
  NetBird is a WireGuard-based mesh network platform that connects your devices
  into a secure private network. It provides zero-configuration VPN with
  automatic peer discovery, NAT traversal, and end-to-end encryption. NetBird
  eliminates the need for complex VPN server setups by creating a peer-to-peer
  mesh network where devices can communicate directly with each other. Perfect
  for remote access, secure site-to-site connections, and building private
  networks without exposing infrastructure to the internet. Built on modern
  WireGuard protocol for maximum performance and security.

instructions:
  To use NetBird, first create an account at https://netbird.io or deploy your
  own NetBird management server. Then generate a setup key from your NetBird
  dashboard. When deploying this template, enter the setup key in the
  NB_SETUP_KEY field. The client will automatically connect to your NetBird
  network.
