name: AdGuard Home
description: AdGuard Ad Blocker is a comprehensive tool designed to enhance your
  online experience by eliminating all kinds of ads, including banners, pop-ups,
  and video ads. It not only removes annoying web elements but also saves
  traffic and accelerates page loading. The app works for both browsers and
  apps, ensuring a seamless, ad-free browsing experience. AdGuard also
  prioritizes your privacy by shielding your data from web analytics and online
  trackers. It offers browsing security by protecting against phishing and
  malicious sites. For families, AdGuard provides parental control features,
  shielding children from inappropriate and adult content. The app also
  maintains the functionality and appearance of websites, even after ad sections
  are removed.
instructions: During the setup phase, set the Admin Web Interface Port to 3000.
  To use the DHCP feature, you must also open ports 67/udp 68/tcp-udp.
