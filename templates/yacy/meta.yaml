name: YaCy
description:
  YaCy is a free distributed search engine built on principles of peer-to-peer networks.
  Unlike traditional search engines that rely on centralized servers, YaCy operates in
  a decentralized manner where each user can contribute to the search index. It allows
  you to run your own search portal, create your own web index, and be independent from
  commercial search engine providers. YaCy is perfect for organizations that need private
  search capabilities, intranet search solutions, or those who value privacy and freedom
  in their search experience.
