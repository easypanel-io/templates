name: Dozzle
description:
  Dozzle is a lightweight, web-based Docker log viewer designed for real-time
  monitoring and easy troubleshooting. It allows you to view logs of other
  Docker containers in real-time, streaming new log entries to the web interface
  without the need for page refreshes. Despite its capabilities, Dozzle is a
  small application that consumes very little memory and CPU, ensuring it
  doesn't cause performance issues when run alongside other containers. It also
  supports connecting to multiple remote hosts, providing a simple drop-down
  menu to switch between different hosts. Dozzle doesn't store any log files and
  is solely for live monitoring of your container logs. It also features an
  intelligent fuzzy search for container names, regex log search, split screen
  for viewing multiple logs, and live stats with memory and CPU usage. It also
  provides authentication with a username and password for added security.
