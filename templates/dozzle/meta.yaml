name: Dozzle
description: Dozzle is a lightweight, web-based application designed to monitor
  Docker logs in real-time. It provides an easy-to-use interface for
  troubleshooting and real-time logging, allowing you to view logs of other
  Docker containers as they are generated, without the need to refresh the page.
  Despite its powerful capabilities, Dozzle is designed to consume very little
  memory and CPU, ensuring it won't cause performance issues when run alongside
  other containers. It also supports connecting to multiple remote hosts, making
  it a versatile tool for managing Docker logs. Dozzle doesn't store any log
  files and is primarily intended for live monitoring of container logs. It also
  offers features like intelligent fuzzy search for container names, regex log
  search, split screen for viewing multiple logs, and live stats with memory and
  CPU usage. Dozzle is open-sourced and released under the MIT License.
