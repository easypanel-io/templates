name: CubeJS
description:
  Cube is a Semantic Layer for every data app that aims to connect data silos,
  drive consistent metrics, and power your AI and analytics with context. It
  allows you to define and manage metrics upstream to consolidate your workflow,
  centralize definitions, and create a single source of truth. The app also
  provides granular access controls to grant column- and role-based operational
  and viewing permissions upstream. Cube ensures your data is reliably
  performant with a powerful caching layer and advanced preaggregation
  capabilities. Furthermore, it allows you to connect your data to any front-end
  application to build beautiful custom visualizations with Cube’s GraphQL,
  REST, and SQL APIs. Cube is an API-first, four-part semantic layer that
  enables data engineers and developers to make their data consistent, secure,
  performant, and accessible across every application.

benefits:
  - title: Unified Data Management
    description:
      The app serves as a semantic layer for every data application, connecting
      data silos and driving consistent metrics. It powers your AI and analytics
      with context, creating a single source of truth for your data.
  - title: Enhanced Data Security
    description:
      The app provides granular access controls, granting column- and role-based
      operational and viewing permissions. It ensures that only the right people
      have access to the right metrics.
  - title: Optimized Performance
    description:
      With a powerful caching layer and advanced pre-aggregation capabilities,
      the app ensures your data is reliably performant. It keeps every
      downstream app updated with the latest information cost-effectively and
      with low latency.
  - title: Universal Compatibility
    description:
      The app allows you to connect your data to any front-end application. With
      Cube’s GraphQL, REST, and SQL APIs, it provides the universal
      compatibility data engineers and developers need.
features:
  - title: Data Modeling
    description:
      Define and manage metrics upstream to consolidate your workflow,
      centralize definitions, and create a single source of truth. The app uses
      Data Models to model raw data into meaningful business definitions and
      pre-aggregate data for optimal results.
  - title: Access Control
    description:
      Grant column- and role-based operational and viewing permissions upstream
      with granular access controls. In the app, authorization is based on the
      security context, and authentication tokens are generated based on your
      API secret.
  - title: Caching
    description:
      "Ensure your data is reliably performant with a powerful caching layer and
      advanced pre-aggregation capabilities. The app provides a two-level
      caching system: in-memory cache and configurable pre-aggregations."
  - title: APIs
    description:
      Connect your data to any front-end application to build beautiful custom
      visualizations. The app’s SQL, REST, and GraphQL APIs provide the
      universal compatibility data engineers and developers need.
