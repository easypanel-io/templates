description: Cube is a Semantic Layer for every data application, designed to
  connect data silos, drive consistent metrics, and power your AI and analytics
  with context. It allows you to define and manage metrics upstream, creating a
  centralized, single source of truth for your data. With Cube, you can grant
  column- and role-based operational and viewing permissions upstream, ensuring
  only the right people have access to the right metrics. It also provides a
  powerful caching layer to ensure your data is reliably performant. Cube's APIs
  allow you to connect your data to any front-end application, enabling you to
  build beautiful custom visualizations. It is an API-first, four-part semantic
  layer that makes your data consistent, secure, performant, and accessible
  across every application.
