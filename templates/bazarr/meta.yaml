name: Bazarr
description:
  Bazarr is a companion application to Sonarr and Radarr, designed to manage and
  download subtitles based on your specific needs. It allows you to define your
  preferences by TV show or movie, and Bazarr handles the rest. The app
  automatically searches for missing subtitles and downloads them as soon as
  they become available in your desired language. It also offers a manual search
  feature to find all matching subtitles, allowing you to choose the one you
  want and download it to your media directory. Bazarr also regularly searches
  for matching subtitles and upgrades the ones you previously downloaded if a
  better one is found. Please note that Bazarr does not scan the disk to detect
  series and movies, it only manages the series and movies that are indexed in
  Sonarr and Radarr.
