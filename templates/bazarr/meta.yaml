name: Bazarr
description: Bazarr is a companion application to Sonarr and Radarr, designed to
  manage and download subtitles based on your specific needs. It automatically
  searches for missing subtitles in your desired language and downloads them as
  soon as they become available. You can also manually search for matching
  subtitles, choose the one you prefer, and download it to your media directory.
  The app regularly searches for matching subtitles and upgrades the ones you've
  previously downloaded if a better version is found. Bazarr doesn't scan disk
  to detect series and movies, it only takes care of the series and movies that
  are indexed in Sonarr and Radarr. It supports 184 subtitles languages with
  support for forced/foreign subtitles depending on providers.
