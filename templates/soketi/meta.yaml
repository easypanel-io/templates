name: Soketi
description:
  Soketi Serverless is an open-source WebSockets server that offers a
  cost-effective, fast, and resilient solution for real-time deployment to
  Cloudflare. It is designed to be cheaper than any competitor, as you only pay
  for your infrastructure. It guarantees core message delivery in less than
  100ms, thanks to its construction on top of C and porting to Node.js. Soketi
  is compatible with Pusher Protocol v7, meaning you can connect to the server
  without needing to replace your existing code. It is ready for production and
  can scale to hundreds of servers with Redis or NATS without losing
  performance. Soketi also offers built-in app management, allowing you to
  define your own app credentials and read from any database. Additionally, it
  features HTTP Webhooks that trigger HTTP requests whenever a channel gets
  occupied. Soketi can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers, bringing it closer to
  your users worldwide. It is also compatible with most popular databases, like
  MySQL or DynamoDB.
