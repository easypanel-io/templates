description: Meet Cachet, the open-source status page system that is
  revolutionizing the way companies communicate downtime and system outages.
  Used by great companies worldwide, Cachet allows you to list your service
  components, report incidents, and customize the look of your status page. It
  also supports markdown for incident messages and is multi-lingual, supporting
  over ten languages. With Cachet, you can schedule maintenance events ahead of
  time and once the maintenance time has passed, the incident drops into the
  timeline for posterity. The app also allows you to set up metrics to measure
  anything from uptime to error rates. For added security, Cachet supports
  two-factor authentication, compatible with the Google Authenticator app.
  Cachet is not just beautifully crafted in design, but also in code, working
  seamlessly on your desktop, tablet, and phone.
