name: LocalAI
description:
  LocalAI is a drop-in replacement REST API that's compatible with OpenAI API
  specifications for local inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate
  images, audio (and not only) locally or on-premises with consumer grade
  hardware, supporting multiple model families and not requiring GPU.
