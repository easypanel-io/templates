  and reducing the cost of conforming all saved images to specific formats.
  imgproxy offers a wide range of features for editing images, including
  resizing, cropping, contrast adjustment, pixelization, saturation, rotating,
  and more. It also provides security features to protect against common attack
  vectors in image processing. With imgproxy, you can upload images directly to
