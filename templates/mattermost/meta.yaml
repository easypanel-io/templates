name: Mattermost
description: Mattermost Version 8.0 is a secure collaboration platform designed
  for technical and operational teams. It offers a workspace where teams can
  collaborate effectively without sacrificing security. The app helps to improve
  response time by 90% and decrease incident resolution time while ensuring full
  data control. It also aids in avoiding costly outages and downtime by
  decreasing the frequency and severity of system failures. Mattermost increases
  information availability by executing complex workflows faster and at a higher
  quality. It features team messaging, custom integrations, audio and screen
  sharing, and workflow automation. The app is designed for enterprise
  scalability and can be deployed in air-gapped networks and BYOD environments.
  It is cloud-neutral and offers self-host deployment options. Mattermost is
  open source and customizable, allowing you to leverage robust integrations or
  build your own with its App Framework, Plugins, and open APIs.
