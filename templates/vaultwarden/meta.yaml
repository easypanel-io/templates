name: Vaultwarden
description:
  Vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden server implementation designed for
  self-hosted deployments. It is written in Rust and is compatible with the
  official Bitwarden clients. This application is ideal for individuals,
  families, and smaller organizations who find the official resource-heavy
  service undesirable. Vaultwarden supports a wide range of features including
  personal and organization vault support, password sharing and access control,
  file attachments, two-step login via email, Duo, YubiKey, and FIDO2 WebAuthn,
  and many more. It also supports live sync for desktop/browser
  clients/extensions and mobile clients (Android/iOS). However, it does not
  prioritize the development of features mainly useful to larger organizations
  such as single sign-on and directory syncing.

  To access the administration interface, please go to /admin on your
