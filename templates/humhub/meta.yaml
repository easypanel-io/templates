description: HumHub is a flexible open-source social network kit designed to
  facilitate communication and collaboration in a user-friendly environment. It
  allows you to create your own customized social network, social intranet, or
  large social enterprise application tailored to your specific needs. Whether
  you're looking to boost your business, support your customers, educate your
  students, or organize your football club, HumHub provides the tools to make it
  happen. The platform is completely open-source, offering the flexibility to
  extend its functionality using third-party tools, your own creations, or
  existing software. It is a self-hosted solution, giving you full control over
  your server and data. HumHub's communication system operates through 'spaces',
  which can represent anything from a project to a group or a simple topic. You
  can invite multiple users to each space and establish your own access rights
  and rules. The platform also offers a range of features including live
  updates, notifications, an activity stream, a dashboard, social tools, user
  profiles, groups, a directory, file sharing, public access, and a search
  function. It is mobile-ready, making it accessible on all modern devices like
  smartphones and tablets.
