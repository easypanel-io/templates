name: RustFS
description:
  RustFS is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage system built in
  Rust. It is 2.3x faster than MinIO for small object payloads and offers full
  S3 API compatibility, a built-in web management console, erasure coding with
  Reed-Solomon for data protection, bitrot detection via HighwayHash, and
  server-side encryption with AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305. RustFS supports
  event notifications, bucket versioning, object lifecycle management, bucket
  replication, and CORS configuration. Licensed under the permissive Apache 2.0
  license, it is designed for data lakes, AI workloads, and large-scale storage
  with a user-friendly deployment experience.
