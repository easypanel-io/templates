name: Docker Registry
description: The Docker Registry 2.0 is an efficient, secure, and reliable tool
  for storing and distributing Docker images. It is an implementation of the
  Docker Registry HTTP API V2, designed to work with Docker 1.6 and above. The
  app allows you to run a local registry, pull images, tag them, and push them
  to the registry. It is a core component for many registry operators including
  Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, GitLab Container Registry and
  DigitalOcean Container Registry. The Docker Registry 2.0 is designed to
  provide a simple, secure, and scalable base for building a large scale
  registry solution or running a simple private registry.
instructions: The Registry doesn't have a UI. To interact with the registry you
  should use the Docker CLI.
