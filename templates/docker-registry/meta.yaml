name: Docker Registry
description: Docker Registry 2.0 is a powerful application designed to store and
  distribute Docker images. This app is an implementation of the Docker Registry
  HTTP API V2, compatible with Docker 1.6 and later versions. It provides a
  secure and scalable base for building a large scale registry solution or
  running a simple private registry. Docker Registry 2.0 is a core library for
  many registry operators including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry,
  GitLab Container Registry, and DigitalOcean Container Registry. It is also
  used by the CNCF Harbor Project and VMware Harbor Registry. The app allows
  users to efficiently store, manage, package, and exchange content, providing a
  professional grade and extensible content distribution system.
instructions: The Registry doesn't have a UI. To interact with the registry you
  should use the Docker CLI.
