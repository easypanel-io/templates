description:
  Docker Registry 2.0 is a powerful application designed to store and distribute
  Docker images. This app is an implementation of the Docker Registry HTTP API
  V2, compatible with Docker 1.6 and later versions. It provides a secure and
  scalable base for building a large scale registry solution or running a simple
  private registry. Docker Registry 2.0 is a core library for many registry
  operators including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, GitLab Container
  Registry, and DigitalOcean Container Registry. It is also used by the CNCF
  Harbor Project and VMware Harbor Registry. The app allows users to efficiently
  store, manage, package, and exchange content, providing a professional grade
  and extensible content distribution system.
instructions:
  The Registry doesn't have a UI. To interact with the registry you should use
  the Docker CLI.
