name: Browserless
description:
  Browserless is a powerful self-hosted headless browser service designed to
  automate web interactions. It enables developers to run headless Chrome
  instances efficiently for web scraping, testing, PDF generation, and
  automation tasks. Browserless supports Puppeteer, Playwright, and Selenium,
  providing a scalable and secure environment for handling complex browser
  automation tasks. The application is optimized for performance, offering
  session management, request queuing, and robust security features. With
  Browserless, developers can offload browser-based automation to a dedicated
  service, reducing local resource consumption and improving workflow
  efficiency.
