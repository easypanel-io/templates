name: Prometheus
description:
  Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for
  reliability and scalability. It collects metrics from configured targets at
  specified intervals, evaluates rule expressions, and triggers alerts when
  specified conditions are observed. Prometheus stores all data as time-series,
  making it ideal for monitoring application and system performance over time.
  Its powerful query language, PromQL, allows for real-time data analysis, and
  its flexible integrations support various exporters and service discovery
  mechanisms. Prometheus can also integrate with alerting tools like
  Alertmanager to send notifications via email, Slack, or other channels. With
  native support for Docker, Kubernetes, and other container platforms,
  Prometheus provides deep visibility into modern infrastructure and services.
