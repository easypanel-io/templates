name: GoToSocial
description: GoToSocial is an ActivityPub social network server that offers a
  fast, fun, and safety-focused way to connect with friends and share content.
  It's a lightweight and customizable platform that respects your privacy, with
  no tracking or advertising. If you've used platforms like Twitter or Tumblr,
  GoToSocial will feel familiar. You can follow people, make posts, and interact
  with others through favorites, replies, and shares. You can write long or
  short posts, post images, and even limit interactions by posting just to your
  friends. Unlike other platforms, GoToSocial is not designed to be addictive or
  to promote 'must-follow' influencers. Your experience is shaped by who you
  follow and how you interact with them, not by engagement metrics. GoToSocial
  is ideal for small or single-user instances running on low-powered devices,
  offering a simple, secure, and easy-to-maintain solution. It's a unique
  entryway into the Fediverse, offering a different experience from other
  software like Mastodon.
