name: GoToSocial
description:
  GoToSocial is a lightweight, customizable, and safety-focused social network
  server that provides a fun and fast entryway into the Fediverse. It is written
  in Golang and allows you to keep in touch with friends, post, read, and share
  images and articles without being tracked or advertised to. If you've used
  platforms like Twitter or Tumblr, GoToSocial will feel familiar. You can
  follow people, have followers, make posts that others can favorite, reply to,
  and share, and scroll through posts from people you follow using a timeline.
  You can write long or short posts, post images, and even block people or limit
  unwanted interactions by posting just to your friends. GoToSocial is not
  designed for influencers with tens of thousands of followers, nor is it
  designed to be addictive. Your timeline and experience are shaped by who you
  follow and how you interact with people, not by engagement metrics. GoToSocial
  is ideal for small or single-user instances running on low-powered devices,
  like single-board computers or old laptops repurposed as home servers. It is
  simple to install and maintain, and prioritizes good security and sensible
  defaults.
