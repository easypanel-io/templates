name: Hammond
description: Hammond is a self-hosted vehicle management system designed to
  track fuel and other expenses related to all your vehicles. The app supports
  multiple users, allowing for shared usage across multiple vehicles. It is an
  ideal tool for those who want to keep a close eye on their vehicle expenses,
  with features that allow you to add and manage multiple vehicles and users,
  track fuel and other expenses, and share vehicles across multiple users. The
  app also allows you to save attachments against vehicles and make quick
  entries by taking a photo of a receipt or pump screen for later entry. Hammond
  also provides vehicle level and overall reporting, and even allows for data
  migration from Clarkson or import from Fuelly. The current version of Hammond
  is regularly updated, ensuring you always have access to the latest features
  and improvements.
