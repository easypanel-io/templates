name: Gatus
description:
  Gatus is a self-hosted automated service health dashboard that monitors the
  uptime and performance of your services, APIs, and websites. The application
  provides a clean, modern web interface to visualize the health status of all
  your monitored endpoints in real-time. Gatus performs periodic health checks
  on configured endpoints, evaluating custom conditions like HTTP status codes,
  response body content, response times, and more. The dashboard displays
  detailed metrics including uptime percentages, average response times, and
  historical status data. With support for various alerting integrations
  including Discord, Slack, PagerDuty, and custom webhooks, Gatus can notify you
  immediately when services go down or fail health checks. The application
  supports complex condition evaluation using JSON path queries, pattern
  matching, and response time thresholds. Perfect for DevOps teams monitoring
  microservices infrastructure, system administrators tracking critical
  services, developers needing uptime monitoring for their applications, or
  anyone who wants a simple, self-hosted alternative to commercial monitoring
  services with complete control over their health checks and data.

instructions:
  you can modify the config from the config.yaml file in the storage section.
