description: ClickHouse is an open-source database designed for real-time
  applications and analytics. It's renowned for its speed and resource
  efficiency, capable of querying billions of rows in milliseconds. ClickHouse
  is column-oriented, making it particularly suited to Online Analytical
  Processing (OLAP) scenarios, where it can process queries at least 100x faster
  than row-oriented databases. It utilizes all available system resources to
  their full potential to deliver the fastest possible analytical query
  processing. ClickHouse supports a wide range of data sources, including
  databases, data warehouses, streams, logs, analytics, data lake formats, and
  local files. It can be deployed in any environment, whether on your machine or
  in the cloud, and is trusted by developers working with data at scale.
