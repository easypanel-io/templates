      analytics, data lake formats, or local files, ClickHouse can handle it.
features:
  - title: Column-Oriented Databases
    description:
      Unlike row-oriented databases where data is stored in rows, ClickHouse is
      a column-oriented database. This means that data is stored in columns,
      with values from the same columns stored together. This makes ClickHouse
      at least 100x faster in processing most queries.
  - title: Flexible Deployment
    description:
      ClickHouse can be deployed in any environment, whether it's on your
      machine or in the cloud. You can run fast queries on local files without a
      server, spin up a database server with open-source ClickHouse, or deploy a
      fully managed ClickHouse service on AWS or GCP.
  - title: Trusted by Developers
    description:
      ClickHouse is trusted by developers that work with data at scale.
      Companies like Disney+ use ClickHouse to provide analytics for their
      content distribution system, and Uber migrated to ClickHouse from the ELK
      stack for their log analytics platform.
