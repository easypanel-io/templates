name: Memos
description: Memos is a privacy-first, lightweight note-taking service designed
  to help you easily capture and share your thoughts. It is built with a focus
  on privacy, ensuring that all your data remains yours and is saved in a SQLite
  database file. The app supports plain text with Markdown, allowing you to save
  all content as plain text, not HTML, while also supporting a variety of useful
  markdown syntax. Despite being lightweight, Memos is powerful, built using Go
  + React.js + SQLite architecture. It is also customizable, allowing you to
  modify the server name, icon, description, system style, and execution script
  as per your needs. Memos is open source and free forever, reflecting our
  belief that open source is the future. You can use it to capture, customize,
  and share your thoughts without any charges.
