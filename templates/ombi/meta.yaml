name: Ombi
description:
  Ombi allows you to host your own Plex Request and user management system. If
  you are sharing your Plex server with other users, allow them to request new
  content using an easy to manage interface! Manage all your requests for Movies
  and TV with ease, leave notes for the user and get notification when a user
  requests something. Allow your users to post issues against their requests so
  you know there is a problem with the audio etc. Even automatically send them
  weekly newsletters of new content that has been added to your Plex server!
