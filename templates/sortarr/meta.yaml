name: Sortarr
description:
  Sortarr is a read-only analytics and organization tool for Sonarr and Radarr
  media libraries. It provides a data-driven management layer that helps you
  identify missing media, mismatches, and optimization opportunities using real
  playback data from providers like Tautulli, Jellystat, or Plex. Sortarr
  supports multiple Sonarr and Radarr instances, presents a unified PowerBI-like
  spreadsheet interface with actionable insights, and never modifies, moves, or
  renames your media files. All operations are strictly read-only and safe.
instructions:
  On first launch, add your Sonarr/Radarr instances, a history provider
  (Tautulli, Jellystat, or Plex), and a playback provider (Plex). Test
  connections, save configuration, and Sortarr will begin analyzing your
  libraries immediately.
