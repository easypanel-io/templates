name: Postgres Backup
description:
  The postgres-backup-s3 app is a powerful tool designed to backup your
  PostgreSQL databases to Amazon S3. It supports periodic backups, allowing you
  to schedule automatic backups at your convenience. This ensures that your data
  is always safe and can be restored whenever needed. The app also offers the
  option to backup all available databases at once, creating a single archive
  with a timestamp for easy identification. For added security, the app provides
  an encryption feature. By setting an encryption password, your backup can be
  encrypted and only decrypted with the correct password. This app is perfect
  for those who want to ensure their PostgreSQL databases are securely backed up
  in a reliable and efficient manner.
