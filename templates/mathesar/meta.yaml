name: Mathesar
description:
  Mathesar is an open-source database GUI that makes PostgreSQL accessible to
  non-technical users. It provides an intuitive interface for working with
  databases without requiring SQL knowledge. Users can visually create and edit
  tables, modify schemas, browse and manipulate data, and collaborate with team
  members. Built on PostgreSQL, it leverages the power and reliability of this
  proven database while adding user-friendly features like spreadsheet-like data
  editing, relationship visualization, and automated schema management. Mathesar
  is perfect for teams that need to work with data collaboratively but don't
  have extensive database expertise. As a self-hosted solution, it gives
  organizations complete control over their data and infrastructure. Whether
  you're managing content, organizing research data, or building internal tools,
  Mathesar makes database operations approachable while maintaining the full
  capabilities of PostgreSQL.
