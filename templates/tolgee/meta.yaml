description:
  Tolgee is a revolutionary localization platform designed to simplify and speed
  up the translation process of your application. With Tolgee, you can translate
  your app into any language without modifying your code. It offers a range of
  features including in-context translating, translation memory, machine
  translations, auto translation, and activity log. The in-context translating
  feature allows you to translate strings directly in the app you develop, even
  in production. Translation memory ensures you don't translate the same string
  twice by reusing strings you've already translated. Machine translations let
  you leverage the power of DeepL, Google Translate, and AWS translate. Auto
  translation delivers your translations instantly right after you add them. The
  activity log feature helps you monitor the translation activities. Tolgee also
  allows users to add screenshots with a single click, providing context for
  translations. It is designed to be developer-friendly with easy integration
  with all major JS frameworks. Tolgee is not only easy to use for developers
  but also for translators, making the localization process seamless and
  efficient.
