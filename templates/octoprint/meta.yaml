  OctoPrint is a comprehensive web interface designed to provide full remote
  control and monitoring of your 3D printer. It allows you to manage every
  aspect of your 3D printing jobs directly from your browser. With OctoPrint,
  you can access the embedded webcam feed to watch your printer in action,
  receive constant feedback on the progress of your print job, and even view a
  rendition of the GCODE you are currently printing. The app also enables you to
  monitor and adjust the temperatures of your hotends and print bed on the fly,
  move the print head along all axes, and start, stop, or pause your print job
  at any time. OctoPrint is compatible with most consumer 3D printers and its
  powerful plugin system allows for functionality extension. It is 100% open
  source, allowing everyone to modify it to their own needs. Additional features
  include creating timelapse recordings of your prints, slicing your STL files
  directly within the app, built-in access controls, and the ability to add
  system commands to the menu for easy shutdown or reboot of your OctoPrint
  server or printer.
