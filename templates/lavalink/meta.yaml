description: Lavalink is a standalone audio sending node designed to facilitate
  the process of sending audio without it ever reaching any of your shards. It
  is powered by Lavaplayer and Koe, and is currently being used in production by
  several popular bots. The app offers a range of features including
  Twitch/YouTube stream support, an event system, seeking, volume control, and a
  REST API for resolving Lavaplayer tracks and controlling players. It also
  provides statistics which are useful for load balancing. Lavalink is designed
  to have a minimal CPU/memory footprint, and it supports plugins. It is
  compatible with Java 17 LTS or newer, and it follows Semantic Versioning.
