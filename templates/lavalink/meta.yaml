name: Lavalink
description: Lavalink is a standalone audio sending node designed to streamline
  the process of sending audio without it ever reaching any of your shards. It
  is powered by Lavaplayer and Koe, and is currently being utilized by popular
  platforms such as FredBoat, Dyno, LewdBot, and more. Lavalink offers a range
  of features including Twitch/YouTube stream support, an event system, seeking,
  volume control, and a REST API for resolving Lavaplayer tracks and controlling
  players. It also provides statistics that are useful for load balancing, basic
  authentication, Prometheus metrics, Docker images, and plugin support.
  Lavalink is designed to have a minimal CPU/memory footprint, making it an
  efficient choice for your audio sending needs.
