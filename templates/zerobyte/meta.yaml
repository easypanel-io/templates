description:
  Zerobyte is a self-hosted backup and restore management solution that provides
  a unified web interface for managing your backup repositories across multiple
  storage backends. It supports various cloud storage providers including
  S3-compatible storage, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and local
  directories through rclone integration. With its intuitive web interface, you
  can configure backup sources, manage multiple repositories, schedule backups,
  and perform restores with ease. The application leverages FUSE filesystem
  capabilities to mount and interact with cloud storage as if it were local
  storage, enabling seamless backup and restore operations. Zerobyte features
  automatic backup scheduling, support for multiple storage backends, encrypted
  backup repositories, incremental backups for efficient storage usage, and
  comprehensive restore capabilities. The web-based dashboard allows you to
  monitor backup status, view repository statistics, and manage your backup
  configurations without command-line tools. Perfect for home lab enthusiasts
  who need reliable backup solutions, system administrators managing multiple
  backup repositories, organizations requiring self-hosted backup
  infrastructure, or anyone who wants to maintain control over their backup data
  with support for various cloud providers and local storage options.

instructions:
  Zerobyte requires access to the /dev/fuse device for FUSE filesystem
  operations. After deploying this template, you may need to manually configure
  device access on your host system.
