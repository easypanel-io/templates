name: FOSSFlow
description:
  FOSSFlow is an open-source diagramming and flowchart application that enables
  users to create, edit, and manage technical diagrams, flowcharts, and process
  visualizations. Built for developers, system architects, and technical teams,
  FOSSFlow provides an intuitive interface for designing workflows, system
  architectures, database schemas, and network diagrams. The application
  supports server-side storage for persistent diagram saving and optional Git
  backup integration for version control and collaboration. With a lightweight
  Node.js backend and modern frontend, FOSSFlow offers a self-hosted alternative
  to cloud-based diagramming tools, giving you complete control over your
  technical documentation and diagrams. Perfect for teams that need to document
  systems, design workflows, create technical specifications, and maintain
  architectural diagrams without relying on external services or sharing
  sensitive information with third parties.
