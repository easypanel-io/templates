name: Cupdate
description:
  Cupdate is a self-hosted web application for monitoring and managing Docker
  container updates. It provides a centralized dashboard to track available
  updates for your running containers, view container versions, and manage
  update notifications. By connecting to the Docker daemon via the Docker
  socket, Cupdate scans all running containers and checks for newer image
  versions available in container registries. The web interface displays an
  overview of your container infrastructure with update status, image tags,
  registry information, and visual indicators for outdated containers. Cupdate
  features automatic update checking on a configurable schedule, support for
  multiple container registries, detailed container information with links to
  documentation and registries, and the ability to manage container logos and
  metadata. With its lightweight architecture and persistent storage using
  BoltDB and SQLite, Cupdate offers an efficient solution for staying informed
  about container updates without requiring complex automation or CI/CD
  pipelines. Perfect for home lab administrators managing multiple Docker
  containers, DevOps teams maintaining staging environments, system
  administrators tracking container versions across servers, or anyone who wants
  visibility into their Docker infrastructure's update status without manually
  checking each container.
