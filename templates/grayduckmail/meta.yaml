name: Gray Duck Mail
description: Gray Duck Mail is an intuitive and user-friendly email discussion
  list app. It is a great alternative to traditional email discussion group
  software like Mailman and Sympa, offering easy setup and management. The app
  is designed to handle email discussion lists effortlessly, making it perfect
  for small to medium-sized groups such as neighborhoods, schools, workplaces,
  and families. With Gray Duck Mail, you can send one email and automatically
  keep everyone in the loop. The app monitors a remote mail server for messages
  and processes them by relaying the message to all list members. It also
  automatically handles user subscriptions, unsubscription requests, and email
  bounces. Gray Duck Mail works with any external email host that allows for
  POP3/SMTP connections and message forwarding or aliasing. It relies totally on
  an external mail provider, allowing you to use an existing web host or email
  account.
