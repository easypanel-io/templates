name: AnonUpload
description: AnonUpload is a secure and anonymous file uploading app that
  doesn't require a database. It is built with privacy as a priority, ensuring
  that the direct filename used is not displayed. The app is designed to work
  universally, compatible with Nginx, Apache, Lightspeed, and more. It doesn't
  rely on rewrites, but uses pure PHP. AnonUpload supports a wide range of file
  types including jpeg, jpg, gif, png, zip, xls, doc, mp3, mp4, mpeg, wav, avi,
  rar, 7z, txt, and more. It also allows for size verification of uploaded
  files, and you can set the maximum and minimum file size for uploads. The app
  also includes a feature to set a waiting time before a file can be downloaded.
