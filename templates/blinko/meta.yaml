name: Blinko
description:
  Blinko (space) is an open-source, self-hosted “idea hub” that rolls notes,
  micro-blog posts, paste-bins and lightweight tasks into one minimalist,
  card-style interface. You jot down thoughts in plain text or Markdown; behind
  the scenes Blinko indexes every word with an AI-powered RAG engine (works with
  OpenAI or a local Ollama model), so you can later retrieve anything with
  natural-language search instead of keywords
