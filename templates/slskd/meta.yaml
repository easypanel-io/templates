name: slskd
description:
  slskd is a modern, web-based client for the Soulseek peer-to-peer file sharing
  network. It provides a clean, intuitive web interface for browsing, searching,
  and downloading files from the Soulseek network. Unlike traditional desktop
  clients, slskd runs as a daemon service that you can access from any device
  with a web browser. The application supports all core Soulseek features
  including user searches, room browsing, private messaging, and file sharing.
  With its containerized deployment, slskd makes it easy to run a persistent
  Soulseek client on a server or NAS device. It's perfect for music enthusiasts,
  collectors, and anyone who wants to participate in the Soulseek community
  without running a desktop application. The daemon continues to operate even
  when you're not actively using the web interface, ensuring you never miss
  downloads or messages.
instructions: Default credentials are slskd/slskd.
