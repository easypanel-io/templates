description:
  Windmill Cloud is a powerful tool that transforms scripts into workflows and
  user interfaces in just a few minutes. It is designed to help you create
  internal apps and robust workflows using code only where necessary. With
  Windmill Cloud, you can make your scripts production-grade and build all your
  internal tools using Python, Typescript, Go, Bash, Sql. You can compose your
  scripts as workflows using low-code and share an autogenerated UI or build one
  using low-code. The app is designed to run reliably at scale on your
  infrastructure or ours, with permissioning and monitoring included. It is a
  fully open-source alternative to Airplane, Superblocks & Retool, and it's easy
  to deploy on both small and large infrastructures. With Windmill Cloud, you
  can run long-running heavy background jobs, script with complex dependencies,
  endpoints with high rpm or simple one-off tasks without any overhead. You can
  trigger them from a webhook or the auto-generated UI and monitor them easily.
  Additionally, Windmill Cloud allows you to build complex flows without
  complexity, from atomic scripts, either from your workspace or the Hub. You
  can also build super fast and powerful apps using drag and drop components,
  connect your data and deploy your app in minutes. Windmill Cloud is designed
  to be super performant, ensuring your app is always running smoothly, even
  when running complex apps.
