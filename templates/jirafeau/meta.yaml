name: Jirafeau
description: Jirafeau is an open-source software designed to simplify the
  process of file sharing. With a one-click-filesharing system, you can easily
  select your file, upload it, and share a link. The app allows you to send
  large files, thanks to the HTML5 file API, making the PHP post_max_size limit
  irrelevant. It provides a real-time progress report, showing speed,
  percentage, and remaining upload time. Jirafeau also allows you to preview
  content in your browser, if possible, and offers optional password protection
  for both uploading and downloading. You can set an expiration time for
  downloads and choose to self-destruct the file after the first download. The
  app also provides shortened URLs using base 64 encoding and the maximum upload
  size is configurable. Jirafeau also includes a small administration interface
  and a basic, adaptable 'Terms Of Service' page.
