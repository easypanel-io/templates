name: Jirafeau
description:
  Jirafeau is an open-source software designed for simple and efficient file
  sharing. It operates on a 'one-click-filesharing' principle, where you select
  your file, upload it, and share a link. The app allows you to send large files
  without any size limit, thanks to the HTML5 file API. It also provides a
  real-time progress report, showing speed, percentage, and remaining upload
  time. Jirafeau offers optional password protection for both uploading and
  downloading, and you can set an expiration time for downloads. The app also
  has a self-destruct feature, which deletes the file after the first download.
  It uses base 64 encoding to shorten URLs and allows for maximal upload size
  configuration. Jirafeau also features optional data encryption and a small
  administration interface.

      percentage, and remaining upload time.

      before downloading.

      For added security, Jirafeau offers optional data encryption. The
      decryption key is sent to the user and not stored on the server.
