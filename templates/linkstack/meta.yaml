  LinkStack is a powerful open-source alternative to Linktree, designed to
  provide an efficient solution for managing and sharing links online. It offers
  a highly customizable link sharing platform with an intuitive, user-friendly
  interface. Unlike other link management platforms, LinkStack allows users to
  host their links on their own web server or web hosting provider, giving them
  complete control over their online presence. This makes LinkStack an ideal
  solution for businesses and organizations looking to manage multiple links.
  With LinkStack, users can easily link to their own custom page and provide
  their followers with access to all the links they need in one convenient
  location. LinkStack also offers a self-hosted option for users who want
  complete control over their data without having it sold to third-party
  companies. The platform can be easily implemented through a simple drag and
  drop process, eliminating the need for complex terminal commands or source
  code manipulation. LinkStack is committed to providing a free, privacy-focused
  solution for managing and sharing links online, without sacrificing user
  privacy and control over their data.
