name: LinkStack
description: LinkStack is an open-source alternative to Linktree, designed to
  provide an efficient solution for managing and sharing links online. It offers
  a highly customizable link sharing platform with an intuitive user interface.
  Unlike other link management platforms, LinkStack allows users to host their
  links on their own web server or web hosting provider, giving them complete
  control over their online presence. Users can easily link to their custom page
  and provide their followers with access to all the links they need in one
  convenient location. LinkStack also allows other users to register and create
  their own links, making it an ideal solution for businesses and organizations
  looking to manage multiple links. The platform is privacy-focused, offering a
  self-hosted option for users who want complete control over their data without
  having it sold to third-party companies. It can be easily implemented through
  a simple drag and drop process, eliminating the need for complex terminal
  commands or source code manipulation.
