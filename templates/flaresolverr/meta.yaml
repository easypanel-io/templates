name: FlareSolverr
description:
  FlareSolverr is a proxy server designed to help bots and scripts bypass web
  protections like Cloudflare's anti-bot page. It acts as an intermediary that
  can execute JavaScript and handle cookies and sessions, making it appear as if
  requests are coming from a real web browser. This tool is particularly useful
  for web scraping and automated data collection tasks where access to
  JavaScript-heavy websites is required. FlareSolverr supports multiple
  platforms and can be integrated into existing scraping setups to solve
  CAPTCHAs and manage browser sessions efficiently.
