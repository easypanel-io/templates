  metadata enforcement, and cover generation. Features include an in-browser
  reader for EPUB, PDF, and CBR formats, OPDS catalog for e-reader apps, Kobo
  and KOReader sync, Send-to-Kindle, multi-user management with fine-grained
  permissions, OAuth/OIDC authentication, automatic backups, and support for 20+
