description: Gotenberg is a Docker-powered stateless API designed for handling
  PDF files. It provides a developer-friendly API to interact with powerful
  tools like Chromium and LibreOffice, enabling the conversion of numerous
  document formats such as HTML, Markdown, Word, Excel, and more into PDF files.
  The app also offers features like document merging. Gotenberg is built as a
  modular platform, allowing for customization of each module to suit your
  specific needs. It also supports an asynchronous workflow, with a webhook
  feature that allows you to upload the output file to your chosen destination.
