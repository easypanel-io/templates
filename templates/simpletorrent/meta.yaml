name: SimpleTorrent
description:
  SimpleTorrent is a self-hosted remote torrent client that allows you to manage
  your torrents remotely. Written in Go (golang), it enables you to start
  torrents remotely and download sets of files on the local disk of the server.
  These files are then retrievable or streamable via HTTP. The app offers
  individual file download control, the ability to run an external program on
  task completion, and a seeding ratio to stop tasks when reached. It also
  provides a download/upload speed limiter and detailed transfer stats in the
  web UI. SimpleTorrent supports real-time updates, is mobile-friendly, and
  offers a fast content server. It also supports IPv6 out of the box and has an
  updated torrent engine from anacrolix/torrent. Additional features include a
  torrent watcher, K8s/docker health-check endpoint, extra trackers from an
  external source, and a protocol handler to magnet.

benefits:
  - title: Remote Torrent Management
    description:
      SimpleTorrent allows you to manage your torrents remotely. You can start
      torrents from anywhere and have them download files directly to the
      server's local disk. This makes it easy to manage your downloads without
      needing to be physically present at the server.
  - title: Streamable Downloads
    description:
      Once your files are downloaded to the server, they are retrievable or
      streamable via HTTP. This means you can access your downloaded content
      from any device with an internet connection, making it highly convenient
      and flexible.
  - title: Control Over Individual File Downloads
    description:
      SimpleTorrent gives you the ability to control individual file downloads.
      This means you can choose exactly which files you want to download from a
      torrent, giving you greater control over your downloads and saving server
      space.

      These features allow you to limit your upload and download speeds. This
