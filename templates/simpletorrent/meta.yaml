name: SimpleTorrent
description: SimpleTorrent is a self-hosted remote torrent client that allows
  you to manage your torrents remotely. Written in Go (golang), it enables you
  to start torrents remotely and download sets of files on the local disk of the
  server. These files are then retrievable or streamable via HTTP. The app
  offers individual file download control, the ability to run an external
  program on task completion, and a seeding ratio to stop tasks when reached. It
  also provides a download/upload speed limiter and detailed transfer stats in
  the web UI. SimpleTorrent supports real-time updates, is mobile-friendly, and
  offers a fast content server. It also supports IPv6 out of the box and has an
  updated torrent engine from anacrolix/torrent. Additional features include a
  torrent watcher, K8s/docker health-check endpoint, extra trackers from an
  external source, and a protocol handler to magnet.

benefits:
  - title: Remote Torrent Management
    description:
      SimpleTorrent allows you to manage your torrents remotely. You can
      start torrents from anywhere and have them download files directly to the
      server's local disk. This makes it easy to manage your downloads without
      needing to be physically present at the server.
  - title: Streamable Downloads
    description:
      Once your files are downloaded to the server, they are retrievable
      or streamable via HTTP. This means you can access your downloaded content
      from any device with an internet connection, making it highly convenient
      and flexible.
  - title: Control Over Individual File Downloads
    description: SimpleTorrent gives you the ability to control individual file
      downloads. This means you can choose exactly which files you want to
      download from a torrent, giving you greater control over your downloads
      and saving server space.
features:
  - title: DoneCmd

      completion of tasks. This can be useful for automating processes or
      triggering events once a download is complete.
  - title: SeedRatio
    description:
      This feature stops a task when a certain seeding ratio is reached.
      This allows you to control how much you seed back to the torrent community
      after your download is complete.
  - title: UploadRate/DownloadRate
    description:
      These features allow you to limit your upload and download speeds.
      This can be useful for managing bandwidth usage on your server.
  - title: Torrent Watcher
