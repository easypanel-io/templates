name: GHStats
description:
  GHStats is a self-hosted GitHub statistics and analytics tool that helps you
  track and visualize your GitHub repository metrics. Monitor stars, traffic,
  clones, views, and other important repository statistics over time with an
  intuitive web interface. The application collects and stores historical data
  from your GitHub repositories, allowing you to analyze trends and growth
  patterns that would otherwise be lost after GitHub's 14-day statistics
  retention period. Perfect for developers, project maintainers, and
  organizations who want to maintain long-term analytics of their GitHub
  presence. GHStats requires a GitHub personal access token to fetch repository
  statistics and stores all collected data persistently for historical analysis
  and visualization.
