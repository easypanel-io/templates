name: mCaptcha
description:
  mCaptcha is a proof-of-work based captcha system that prioritizes user privacy
  and offers a fully automated experience. Unlike traditional captcha systems,
  mCaptcha does not track or profile users, ensuring a privacy-focused user
  experience. It is designed to be robust and accurate, not relying on IP
  addresses for rate-limiting, making it suitable for users behind NATs. The
  user experience is silent and seamless, eliminating the need for annoying
  image-based captchas. mCaptcha uses a proof-of-work solution to fiercely
  defend your site, making it more expensive for attackers to target your site
  than for you to respond to their requests. It is a libre software, with client
  libraries licensed under proprietary-friendly free software licenses. mCaptcha
  is also compatible with reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha, making it a convenient drop-in
  replacement. The core functionality of mCaptcha is to use a SHA256 based
  proof-of-work system to rate limit users, providing a token upon successful
  validation that users can then submit with their request or form submission to
  the target website.
