name: mCaptcha
description: mCaptcha is a proof-of-work based captcha system that is designed
  with a focus on privacy and automation. It offers a seamless user experience,
  eliminating the need for annoying images or other traditional captcha methods.
  Instead, mCaptcha uses a SHA256 based proof-of-work (PoW) to rate limit users,
  making it more difficult for attackers to spam your site. The system is silent
  and efficient, so much so that users won't even notice it's there. mCaptcha is
  also compatible with reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha, making it a convenient drop-in
  replacement. The core functionality of mCaptcha is licensed under AGPL,
  ensuring it will always be free. It's a revolutionary technology that can
  change the way the web works, providing a more secure and user-friendly
  experience.
