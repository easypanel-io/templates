name: HyperDX
description:
  HyperDX is an open-source observability platform that unifies logs, metrics,
  traces, and session replays in one place. Built on ClickHouse for blazing-fast
  performance, it allows you to search terabytes of events in seconds without
  complex syntax. Perfect for debugging production issues, monitoring
  application performance, and correlating user sessions with backend traces.
  Recently acquired by ClickHouse to accelerate the future of open-source
  observability.
