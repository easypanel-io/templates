description: FileRun is a private, fully controlled alternative to Google Drive,
  designed to provide instant web access to your files on any server. It allows
  you to manage your files just like you would on an FTP server, with changes
  reflecting instantly. The app supports access via FTP, SMB, WebDAV, and
  desktop sync, and it runs efficiently on any hardware. FileRun also features a
  virtual drive that lets you access files directly from your computer without
  using up disk space. It supports all file types, including photos and videos,
  and allows you to group them together in virtual albums. The app also extracts
  and indexes metadata from your files, enabling you to search them by keywords,
  dates, authors, and more. FileRun also allows you to collaborate with others
  without creating accounts for them, and it has a feature that lets you request
  files from anyone. It also integrates with various plugins and offers secure
  file versioning to prevent accidental overwrites. The app is customizable,
  allowing you to choose color presets and background images to match your
  branding.
