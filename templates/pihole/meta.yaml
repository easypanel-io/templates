name: Pi-hole
description:
  Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole to protect
  your devices from unwanted content without installing any client-side
  software. It blocks ads at the DNS level, meaning ads are blocked before they
  even reach your devices, resulting in faster browsing, reduced bandwidth
  usage, and enhanced privacy. Pi-hole provides a powerful web interface for
  easy management and detailed statistics about your network's DNS queries. It
  can block millions of ad-serving domains and supports custom block lists. The
  application also includes features like DHCP server capabilities,
  DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) support, and comprehensive query logging. With Pi-hole,
  you can monitor all DNS requests on your network, see which domains are being
  blocked, and maintain complete control over your network's DNS filtering.
instructions:
  After the deployment of the Pi-Hole Service, it might not start straight away,
  you have to stop the systemd-resolved.service, or service which would be
  occupying the DNS port 53, make sure you also disable that so it doesn't
  starts on boot.
