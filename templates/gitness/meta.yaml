description: Harness/Gitness is a tool that helps developers test their code more effectively. It provides a way to automatically generate test cases from a Git repository. This can save developers a lot of time and effort, as they no longer need to manually create test cases for each change they make to their code. Harness/Gitness works by analyzing the code in a Git repository to identify potential test cases. It then generates these test cases in a variety of formats, including Python, Java, and JavaScript. Developers can then run these test cases to verify that their code works as expected.
