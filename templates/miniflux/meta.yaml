name: Miniflux
description: Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader designed to
  optimize readability. The app's layout, fonts, and colors are carefully chosen
  to ensure content is easily readable on a screen. If you have feeds that only
  display a summary, Miniflux can fetch the original article automatically for
  you. The app is designed with simplicity in mind, focusing on essential
  features and avoiding unnecessary complexities. It's fast and efficient,
  offering keyboard shortcuts for easy navigation and a lightweight user
  interface for quickly scanning unread items. Miniflux also prioritizes your
  privacy, ensuring no one resells your private data or tracks your usage. It
  automatically removes pixel trackers and does not feature any advertising.
  Miniflux is a free, open-source app distributed under the Apache 2.0 License.
