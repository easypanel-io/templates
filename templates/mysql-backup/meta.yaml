name: MySQL Backup
description: The mysql-backup-s3 app is a powerful tool designed to backup your
  MySQL databases to your AWS S3 bucket. It supports periodic backups, allowing
  you to schedule backup times in cron format, ensuring your data is always safe
  and up-to-date. The app also supports multi-files, meaning you can have one
  file per database if you choose to. The app requires your AWS access key, AWS
  secret key, and AWS S3 bucket path. It also requires your MySQL host, user,
  and password. You can customize the path prefix in your bucket, the AWS S3
  bucket region, and the AWS Endpoint URL. The app also allows you to add extra
  mysqldump options without overriding the default ones. With the
  mysql-backup-s3 app, you can ensure your MySQL databases are always backed up
  and secure in your AWS S3 bucket.
instructions: "In order to test that you configured it properly, remove the
  SCHEDULE variable from the environment, click deploy and check the logs. If
  everything works fine, you can add the SCHEDULE variable back. You can read
