name: Typesense
description:
  Typesense is a powerful, fast, and typo-tolerant search engine designed to
  provide delightful search experiences. It is an open-source alternative to
  Algolia and a more user-friendly alternative to ElasticSearch. Typesense is
  capable of handling typographical errors gracefully, right out of the box. It
  is meticulously architected for low-latency, instant searches, offering a
  response time of less than 50ms. The app allows easy tailoring of search
  results, sorting of results based on a particular field at query time, and
  refining of results through faceting and filtering. It also supports grouping
  of similar results, federated search across multiple collections, geographic
  location-based search and sorting, and vector searching. Typesense also allows
  the generation of API keys for access to specific records, making it suitable
  for multi-tenant applications. It is designed to be simple to set up,
  integrate with, operate, and scale, making it a perfect choice for building
  delightful search experiences.
