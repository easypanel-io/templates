  Dockhand is a modern Docker container management and monitoring tool that
  provides an intuitive web interface for managing your Docker containers,
  images, volumes, and networks. With real-time container statistics, log
  viewing, and container lifecycle management, Dockhand simplifies Docker
  operations for both developers and system administrators. The application
  offers comprehensive container management capabilities including start, stop,
  restart, and removal operations, along with detailed container information and
  resource usage monitoring. Perfect for developers who need a visual interface
  for Docker management, system administrators monitoring container
  infrastructure, or teams looking for an alternative to command-line Docker
  tools.

  necessary permissions to access the Docker daemon.
