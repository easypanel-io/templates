name: Upvote RSS
description:
  Upvote RSS is a self-hosted RSS feed generator for Reddit that creates
  personalized RSS feeds based on Reddit post upvotes. The application connects
  to Reddit's API to monitor posts you've upvoted and generates RSS feeds that
  you can subscribe to in any RSS reader. This allows you to follow your upvoted
  content across different subreddits in a single feed, making it easy to keep
  track of interesting posts and discussions you've engaged with. The
  application uses Reddit OAuth authentication to access your upvoted posts
  securely, caches feed data for performance, and provides a simple web
  interface for accessing your personalized RSS feeds. Perfect for Reddit users
  who want to follow their upvoted content via RSS, power users who prefer RSS
  readers over native Reddit interfaces, content curators who want to track
  interesting posts across multiple subreddits, or anyone looking for a
  self-hosted solution to create custom Reddit RSS feeds based on their
  engagement.
