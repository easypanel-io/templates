name: Kopia
description: Kopia is a robust open-source backup and restore tool designed to
  secure your data. It allows you to create encrypted snapshots of your selected
  files or directories and store them in a location of your choice, be it
  remote, cloud storage, network-attached storage, or locally on your machine.
  Kopia supports a wide range of storage locations including Amazon S3, Azure
  Blob Storage, Backblaze B2, Google Cloud Storage, and many more. It also
  supports both Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI),
  making it suitable for both advanced and regular users. Kopia's unique
  features include compression, deduplication, end-to-end 'zero knowledge'
  encryption, and error correction, ensuring your data is not only secure but
  also efficiently stored. With Kopia, you have full control over where your
  snapshots are stored, and it even allows backing up multiple machines to the
  same storage location.
