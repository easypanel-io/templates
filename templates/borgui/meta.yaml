description:
  Borg UI is a modern web-based interface for BorgBackup, the popular
  deduplicating backup program with compression and authenticated encryption. It
  provides an intuitive dashboard for managing backup repositories, creating and
  scheduling backups, monitoring backup status, and restoring files through a
  user-friendly web interface. BorgBackup is known for its efficiency through
  deduplication at the chunk level, strong encryption using AES-256, and data
  integrity verification. Borg UI simplifies the complexity of command-line
  operations by offering visual repository management, backup job configuration,
  automated scheduling, space-efficient storage tracking, and easy file
  restoration. The self-hosted solution gives you complete control over your
  backup infrastructure while maintaining the security and reliability of
  BorgBackup. With access to your entire filesystem, it can protect any data on
  your server including application files, databases, configurations, and user
  data. Perfect for system administrators, developers, and anyone who needs
  reliable, encrypted, and space-efficient backup solutions without relying on
  proprietary cloud backup services or complex command-line interfaces.
