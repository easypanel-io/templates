name: Ploi Roadmap
description:
  Roadmap is an open-source software designed to streamline your roadmapping
  process. It offers a completely customizable platform where you can mention
  users in comments, upvote items to prioritize them, and generate automatic
  slugs. The software also features a Filament admin panel and a simplified role
  system that includes administrator, employee, and user roles. Roadmap supports
  OAuth 2 single sign-on with your own application and automatically generates
  OG images, including the branding color you've set up. It also integrates with
  GitHub, allowing you to assign a repository to each project and manage issues
  directly from the roadmap admin. The software is built with PHP and requires a
  database to function.
instructions:
  After First Deployment, run "php artisan roadmap:install" to setup the inital
  user account.
