description: Mattermost Boards is an open-source project management tool
  designed for technical teams. It provides a centralized platform where you can
  plan, track, and manage all your work. With Mattermost Boards, you can
  maintain a single source of truth, ensuring your teams stay aligned to
  complete tasks, reach milestones, and achieve their goals. The app allows you
  to organize and visualize your work in a way that suits you best, with options
  to manage tasks on a Kanban, table, gallery, and calendar view. You can focus
  on high-priority items using board filters and save an unlimited number of
  filtered views for quick access later. Real-time collaboration is made easy
  with card comments, @mentions, and board permissions. The app also offers a
  variety of pre-built templates to get you started quickly or the option to
  create a fully custom board from scratch. Mattermost Boards is a trusted tool
  used by teams around the world to accelerate productivity.
