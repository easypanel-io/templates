  board filters. It also offers real-time collaboration features, including card
  comments, @mention teammates, and board permissions to share your board with
  the entire team or specific individuals. Mattermost Boards comes with
  pre-built templates for quick setup or the option to create a fully custom
  board from scratch. It also includes features like unlimited boards, file
  sharing, customizable templates, project cards & tasks, archiving & back-up
  snapshots, and more. Mattermost Boards is an open-source alternative to tools
  like Asana, Trello, and Notion.
