description: Budibase is an open-source platform designed to simplify the
  creation of internal tools, saving teams hundreds of hours of development
  time. With no coding experience required, you can generate powerful tools and
  forms that integrate seamlessly with any workflow. Budibase allows you to
  securely collect data on top of any database, automate tasks and workflows,
  and design your tools with a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. You can

  start from scratch with Budibase's built-in database. With just a few clicks,
  you can automate manual processes and streamline operations within your app
  and business. Budibase is trusted by over 75,000 teams and is designed to
  deliver internal tools that look beautiful and work perfectly across mobile,
  tablet, and desktop.
