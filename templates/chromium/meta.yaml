name: Chromium
description: Chromium is an open-source browser project that is designed to
  provide a safer, faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the
  web. This app is deployed as a Docker container and is designed to be
  multi-platform aware, meaning it can run on various architectures including
  x86-64 and arm64. The app can be accessed via http://yourhost:3000/ or
  https://yourhost:3001/. It also supports additional environment variables and
  run configurations to enable or disable specific functionality. The app also
  allows you to specify one or multiple Chromium CLI flags that will be passed
  to the application in full. This app is designed to avoid permission issues
  that can arise between the host OS and the container by allowing you to
  specify the user PUID and group PGID.
