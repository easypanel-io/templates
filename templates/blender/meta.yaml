name: Blender
description: Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software
  toolset that is used for creating a wide range of visual content. This
  includes animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion
  graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games.
  The app can be accessed at http://yourhost:3000/ or https://yourhost:3001/.
  The app supports multi-platform awareness, which means it can be used on
  various architectures including x86-64 and arm64. However, it does not support
  GPU rendering out of the box, only accelerated workspace experience. The app
  also supports hardware acceleration for your desktop experience, with the
  capability of supporting accelerated rendering with /dev/dri mounted in.
  However, the AMD HIP and Nvidia CUDA runtimes are not installed by default in
  this container.
