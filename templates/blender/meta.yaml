description:
  Blender is a comprehensive, free and open-source 3D computer graphics software
  toolset. It is used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D
  printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality,
  and computer games. The app is designed to be accessed at your host, providing
  a desktop GUI for easy interaction. It supports hardware acceleration for an
  enhanced desktop experience, although GPU rendering is not supported out of
  the box. The app is compatible with multiple architectures, ensuring it can be
  used on a variety of systems. Please note that while this app can run on Arm
  devices, it is recommended not to mount in /dev/dri due to the OpenGL ES
  version not being high enough to run Blender.
