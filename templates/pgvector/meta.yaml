name: pgvector
description:
  pgvector is an open-source app designed to facilitate vector similarity search
  for Postgres. It allows you to store all your application data in one place,
  supporting both exact and approximate nearest neighbor search. The app is
  capable of handling L2 distance, inner product, and cosine distance, making it
  versatile for various data analysis needs. It is compatible with any language
  that has a Postgres client. The app also boasts of ACID compliance,
  point-in-time recovery, JOINs, and all the other great features of Postgres.
  With pgvector, you can create a new table with a vector column or add a vector
  column to an existing table, insert vectors, upsert vectors, update vectors,
  and delete vectors. It also allows you to get the nearest neighbors to a
  vector or a row, and get rows within a certain distance. The app also supports
  indexing for improved search performance. It is a powerful tool for managing
  and analyzing your data in a Postgres environment.
