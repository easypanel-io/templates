name: Ironmount
description:
  Ironmount is a self-hosted cloud storage solution that provides secure,
  private file storage and sharing capabilities. It enables users to mount
  remote storage locations as local filesystems using FUSE (Filesystem in
  Userspace), offering seamless integration with your operating system's file
  manager. Ironmount supports multiple storage backends and provides a web
  interface for managing files, sharing links, and organizing data. With
  built-in encryption, user management, and access control features, Ironmount
  ensures your data remains private and secure on your own infrastructure. The
  application requires elevated system privileges (SYS_ADMIN capability) and
  FUSE device access to mount filesystems. Perfect for individuals and
  organizations seeking complete control over their file storage, secure file
  sharing, and cloud storage alternatives without relying on third-party
  services.
