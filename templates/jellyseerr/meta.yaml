name: Jellyseerr
description: Overseerr is a powerful application designed to integrate
  seamlessly with your Plex media library. It allows you to manage user access,
  sync with your Plex library to show the titles you already have, and integrate
  with Sonarr and Radarr. The app features an easy-to-use request system,
  enabling users to request individual seasons or movies through a clean,
  user-friendly interface. The request management is simple and straightforward,
  eliminating the need to dig through the app to approve recent requests. The
  app is also mobile-friendly, allowing you to approve requests on the go. It
  also supports localization into other languages. Jellyseerr, a fork of
  Overseerr, extends these features to Jellyfin and Emby media servers, with
  full integration and similar functionality. It also allows for easy
  integration with existing services and provides a customizable request system.
  Both apps are designed with a focus on user experience, making media
  requesting and management effortless and efficient.
