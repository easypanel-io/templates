name: Vexa Dashboard
description: |
  Vexa Dashboard is a complete, all-in-one solution for self-hosted meeting transcription. This template deploys both the Vexa API (real-time meeting transcription engine) and its web dashboard in a single click.

  Vexa captures audio from Google Meet and Microsoft Teams meetings, transcribes it in real-time using Whisper AI, and provides a beautiful web interface to manage everything. Own your data, self-host everything, no cloud dependencies.

  This template includes:
  - Vexa API: The transcription engine with bot management
  - Vexa Dashboard: Web interface for managing meetings and transcripts
  - PostgreSQL: Database for storing all your data

  Perfect for teams who want enterprise-grade meeting transcription without sending data to third parties.

instructions: |
  After deployment, open the Vexa Dashboard URL in your browser. You can immediately start joining meetings and transcribing them.

  To enable AI-powered transcript analysis, edit the vexa-dashboard service environment variables and uncomment the AI_MODEL and AI_API_KEY lines.

  For better transcription quality (requires GPU), edit the vexa-api service and change WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE from "tiny" to "medium" or "large-v3", and set DEVICE to "gpu".
