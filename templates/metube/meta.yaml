name: MeTube
description: MeTube is a user-friendly web interface for youtube-dl, a powerful
  tool that lets you download videos from YouTube and dozens of other sites. It
  uses the yt-dlp fork for enhanced functionality, including playlist support.
  With MeTube, you can easily manage your downloads, choose the quality of the
  videos, and even separate audio-only downloads from video downloads. The app
  also supports downloading videos into custom directories and automatically
  creating directories if they do not exist. MeTube also offers a dark mode for
  a comfortable viewing experience. It's designed to run using Docker, ensuring
  a smooth and consistent operation across different platforms.
