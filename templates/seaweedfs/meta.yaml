name: SeaweedFS
description:
  SeaweedFS is a fast, simple, and highly scalable distributed file system for
  storing and serving billions of files. Starting as an object store with O(1)
  disk seek performance, it has grown into a full-featured storage platform
  supporting S3 API, WebDAV, FUSE mount, HDFS, and Hadoop integration. The
  architecture separates concerns into a master server for volume management, a
  volume server for blob storage, a filer for directory/file abstraction, an S3
  gateway for S3 compatibility, and a WebDAV server for mounted drive access.
  Features include erasure coding, cloud tiering, cross-datacenter replication,
  AES-256-GCM encryption, automatic compaction, file TTL, and a built-in admin
  UI. Licensed under Apache 2.0 with 30k+ GitHub stars.
instructions: Open the admin UI.

benefits:
  - title: Billion-File Scale
    description:
      Designed from the ground up to store billions of files with O(1) disk seek
      performance. Each file lookup requires just one disk read operation with
      only 40 bytes of metadata overhead per file.
  - title: Multi-Protocol Access
    description:
      Access your data via S3 API, WebDAV, FUSE mount, HDFS, or the built-in
      Filer HTTP interface. Use the right protocol for every use case without
      data duplication.
  - title: Cloud Tiering & Replication
    description:
      Transparently tier warm data to cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud,
      Azure) while keeping hot data local. Cross-datacenter active-active
      replication ensures high availability.
  - title: Apache 2.0 Licensed
    description:
      Fully open-source under the permissive Apache 2.0 license with no
      restrictive copyleft clauses. Free for commercial and community use.
features:
  - title: S3-Compatible Gateway
    description:
      Full Amazon S3 API compatibility lets you use existing S3 tools, SDKs, and
      applications. Drop-in replacement for cloud object storage.
  - title: WebDAV Server
    description:
      Mount your SeaweedFS storage as a network drive on macOS, Windows, and
      Linux, or access it from mobile devices via WebDAV.
  - title: Admin UI
    description:
      Built-in web administration console for monitoring cluster health,
      managing volumes, viewing topology, and performing maintenance.
  - title: Erasure Coding
    description:
      Reed-Solomon erasure coding (10.4 by default, customizable in Enterprise)
      reduces storage overhead while maintaining data durability across racks.
  - title: Encryption at Rest
    description:
      AES-256-GCM encrypted storage protects data at rest. Combined with TLS for
      data in transit, your files are secured end to end.
  - title: Automatic Compaction
    description:
      Automatically reclaims disk space after file deletion or updates. Combined
      with file TTL support for automatic expiration of temporary data.
