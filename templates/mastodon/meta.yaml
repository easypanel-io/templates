name: Mastodon
description: Mastodon is a unique social networking app that puts control back
  in your hands. It allows you to curate your own home feed without any
  interference from algorithms or ads. You can follow anyone across any Mastodon
  server from a single account and receive their posts in chronological order.
  Mastodon also provides you with the unique possibility of managing your
  audience without any middlemen. It supports audio, video and picture posts,
  accessibility descriptions, polls, content warnings, animated avatars, custom
  emojis, thumbnail crop control, and more, to help you express yourself online.
  Each Mastodon server is a completely independent entity, able to interoperate
  with others to form one global social network. It is built on open web
  protocols and can interact with any other platform that implements
  ActivityPub. Mastodon respects your agency and will never serve ads or push
  profiles for you to see. Your data and your time are yours and yours alone.
instructions: To create an admin account, type "tootctl accounts create username
  --email user@example.com --confirmed --role Owner" on the console.
