name: Mastodon
description: Mastodon is a unique social networking app that puts control back
  in your hands. It allows you to curate your own home feed, free from
  algorithms or ads, ensuring you see only what matters most to you. The app
  supports a wide range of content types, including audio, video, and picture
  posts, polls, content warnings, and more, enabling you to express yourself
  freely online. Mastodon is decentralized and open-source, meaning each server
  is a completely independent entity, yet able to interoperate with others to
  form a global social network. The app respects your agency, never serving ads
  or pushing profiles, and is built on open web protocols, allowing it to
  interact with any other platform that implements ActivityPub. With Mastodon,
  you have the power to manage your audience, moderate content, and create a
  social media experience that truly reflects you.
instructions: To create an admin account, type "tootctl accounts create username

benefits:
  - title: Control Your Own Social Media Experience
    description: Mastodon gives you the power to curate your own home feed, without
      interference from algorithms or ads. Your timeline is filled with what
      matters to you most, not what a corporation thinks you should see.
  - title: Decentralized and Independent
    description: Each Mastodon server is a completely independent entity, yet able
      to interoperate with others to form one global social network. This
      decentralization ensures that instant global communication doesn't belong
      to one company.
  - title: Respect for Your Agency
    description: Mastodon respects your agency. Your feed is curated and created by
      you. We will never serve ads or push profiles for you to see. That means
      your data and your time are yours and yours alone.
features:
  - title: Follow Across Servers
    description: Follow anyone across any Mastodon server from a single account and
      receive their posts in chronological order. Make your corner of the
      internet a little more like you.
  - title: Moderation Your Way
    description: Each server creates their own rules and regulations, which are
      enforced locally and not top-down like corporate social media. Join a
      server with the rules you agree with, or host your own.
  - title: Unparalleled Creativity
    description: Mastodon supports audio, video and picture posts, accessibility
      descriptions, polls, content warnings, animated avatars, custom emojis,
      thumbnail crop control, and more, to help you express yourself online.
  - title: Interoperable
    description: Built on open web protocols, Mastodon can speak with any other
      platform that implements ActivityPub. With one account you get access to a
      whole universe of social apps—the fediverse.
