name: Mastodon
description:
  Mastodon is a unique social networking app that puts control back in your
  hands. It allows you to curate your own home feed, free from algorithms or
  ads, ensuring you see only what matters most to you. The app supports a wide
  range of content types, including audio, video, and picture posts, polls,
  content warnings, and more, enabling you to express yourself freely online.
  Mastodon is decentralized and open-source, meaning each server is a completely
  independent entity, yet able to interoperate with others to form a global
  social network. The app respects your agency, never serving ads or pushing
  profiles, and is built on open web protocols, allowing it to interact with any
  other platform that implements ActivityPub. With Mastodon, you have the power
  to manage your audience, moderate content, and create a social media
  experience that truly reflects you.

benefits:
  - title: Control Your Own Social Media Experience
    description:
      Mastodon gives you the power to curate your own home feed, without
      interference from algorithms or ads. Your timeline is filled with what
      matters to you most, not what a corporation thinks you should see.
  - title: Decentralized and Independent
    description:
      Each Mastodon server is a completely independent entity, yet able to
      interoperate with others to form one global social network. This
      decentralization ensures that instant global communication doesn't belong
      to one company.
  - title: Respect for Your Agency
    description:
      Mastodon respects your agency. Your feed is curated and created by you. We
      will never serve ads or push profiles for you to see. That means your data
      and your time are yours and yours alone.
features:
  - title: Follow Across Servers
    description:
      Follow anyone across any Mastodon server from a single account and receive
      their posts in chronological order. Make your corner of the internet a
      little more like you.
  - title: Moderation Your Way
    description:
      Each server creates their own rules and regulations, which are enforced
      locally and not top-down like corporate social media. Join a server with
      the rules you agree with, or host your own.
  - title: Unparalleled Creativity
    description:
      Mastodon supports audio, video and picture posts, accessibility
      descriptions, polls, content warnings, animated avatars, custom emojis,
      thumbnail crop control, and more, to help you express yourself online.
  - title: Interoperable
    description:
      Built on open web protocols, Mastodon can speak with any other platform
      that implements ActivityPub. With one account you get access to a whole
      universe of social apps—the fediverse.
