description: Flame is a self-hosted startpage for your server, designed to be
  your personal application hub. Its design, inspired by SUI, offers a clean and
  intuitive interface. With Flame, you can easily create, update, and delete
  your applications and bookmarks directly from the app using built-in GUI
  editors. You can pin your favorite items to the homescreen for quick and easy
  access. The app also features an integrated search bar with local filtering,
  11 web search providers, and the ability to add your own. Flame also includes
  an authentication system to protect your settings, apps, and bookmarks. The
  interface is highly customizable with dozens of options, including support for
  custom CSS, 15 built-in color themes, and a custom theme builder. The app also
  features a weather widget with current temperature, cloud coverage, and
  animated weather status. Flame also integrates with Docker to automatically
  pick and add apps based on their labels.
