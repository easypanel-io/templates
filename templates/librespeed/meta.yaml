  LibreSpeed is a free and open-source HTML5-based speed test application that
  you can host on your own server. It provides a lightweight, self-hosted
  alternative to commercial speed test services like Speedtest.net. LibreSpeed
  allows you to measure download speed, upload speed, ping, and jitter of your
  internet connection through a clean, modern web interface. It's perfect for
  network administrators, ISPs, or anyone who wants to monitor their internet
  connection performance without relying on third-party services. The
  application stores test results and provides analytics to track connection
  quality over time.
