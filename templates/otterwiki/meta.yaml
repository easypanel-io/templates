description:
  OtterWiki is a simple, easy-to-use wiki software for personal use and small
  teams. It's designed to be minimalist, focusing on the essentials without
  unnecessary complexity. OtterWiki stores all content as Markdown files in a
  Git repository, providing automatic version control and the ability to edit
  pages using your favorite text editor. It features a clean, modern interface
  with syntax highlighting, file attachments, full-text search, and dark mode
  support. The wiki requires no database setup - everything is stored in plain
  text files, making backups and migrations simple. OtterWiki supports user
  authentication, page permissions, and comes with a built-in editor with live
  preview. Perfect for documentation, note-taking, knowledge management, and
  collaborative writing in small teams.
