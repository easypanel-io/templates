name: Webcord
description: WebCord can be summarized as a pack of security and privacy hardenings, Discord features reimplementations, Electron / Chromium / Discord bugs workarounds, stylesheets, internal pages and wrapped https://discord.com/ page, designed to conform with ToS as much as it is possible (or hide the changes that might violate it from Discord's eyes).
instructions: use abc:abc to login. To access the login interface, add ?login=true to your URL.
