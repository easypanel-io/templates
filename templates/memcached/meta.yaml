name: Memcached
description:
  Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system
  designed for speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database
  load. It works by storing data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of
  times an external data source must be read. Memcached is simple yet powerful,
  featuring a straightforward design that enables rapid deployment, ease of
  development, and solves many problems facing large data caches. It's
  particularly useful for database call, API call, or page rendering result
  caching.

  - title: Simple to Use
    description:
      With a simple design and protocol, Memcached is easy to implement and use
      in your applications.
  - title: Distributed Architecture
    description:
      Scale horizontally by adding more nodes to your Memcached cluster,
      distributing memory and load across multiple machines.

features:
  - title: In-Memory Caching
    description:
      Store frequently accessed data in RAM for lightning-fast retrieval,
      reducing database load.
  - title: Multi-protocol Support
    description:
      Connect to Memcached using various clients in different languages like
      PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and more.
  - title: Key-Value Storage
    description:
      Store any arbitrary data (strings, objects) associated with a key for
      simple retrieval.
  - title: LRU Eviction
    description:
      Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm automatically removes the least-used
