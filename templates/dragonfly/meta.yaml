name: DragonflyDB
description:
  DragonflyDB is a modern, high-performance, Redis-compatible in-memory
  datastore that's designed for cloud workloads. It offers superior performance
  with up to 25x higher throughput than Redis while using fewer resources.
  DragonflyDB is fully compatible with Redis APIs and commands, making it a
  drop-in replacement that doesn't require code changes. It features automatic
  snapshots, optional persistence to disk, built-in replication, and efficient
  memory management. Perfect for caching, session storage, real-time analytics,
  and any use case that requires blazing-fast data access with lower operational
  costs.

instructions:
  After deployment, you can connect to DragonflyDB using any Redis client on
  port 6379. Make sure to use the password you configured for secure access.
  Data is automatically persisted to the mounted volume based on the snapshot
  schedule.
