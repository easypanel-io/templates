name: Handbrake Web
description:
  Handbrake Web is a self-hosted video transcoding solution that provides a
  web-based interface for managing and processing video encoding jobs using the
  powerful HandBrake video transcoder. The application features a distributed
  architecture with a central server for job management and dedicated workers
  for processing, allowing you to scale encoding capacity by adding more
  workers. The web interface enables you to upload videos, configure encoding
  presets, monitor job progress, and manage your transcoding queue from any
  browser. Handbrake Web supports all the encoding formats and options available
  in HandBrake, including H.264, H.265/HEVC, VP9, and AV1 codecs, as well as
  various container formats like MP4, MKV, and WebM. The worker-based
  architecture allows for parallel processing of multiple videos and can
  leverage hardware acceleration when available. Perfect for media enthusiasts
  who need to convert video collections to different formats, content creators
  preparing videos for multiple platforms, home server administrators managing
  media libraries, or anyone who needs a reliable self-hosted solution for batch
  video transcoding without installing desktop applications.
