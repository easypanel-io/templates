description: Coral is a revolutionary app designed to enhance the commenting
  experience on your website. It uses smart technology and effective design to
  improve interactions and engagement. For commenters, Coral offers features
  like identifying journalists in the conversation, muting unwanted voices,
  sharing discussions, receiving notifications, and instant alerts for new
  comments. For moderators, Coral provides a comprehensive suite of tools,
  backed by AI technology, to easily identify disruptive comments and highlight
  the best submissions. For journalists, Coral increases loyalty and engagement
  on your website, giving you complete control of the interactions and data,
  without inserting any ads or trackers on your page. The app is lightweight,
  secure, flexible, and responsive, and can be easily connected to your existing
  registration system. It is fully customizable, allowing you to modify the look
  and feel, and extend the platform with our GraphQL API and by adding features
  to the open source codebase. Coral prioritizes user privacy, with no ads,
  trackers, hidden pixels or marketing scripts in our code, making it more
  secure, faster to load, and transparently better for you and your users.
