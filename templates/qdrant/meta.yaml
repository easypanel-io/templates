name: Qdrant
description:
  Qdrant is a powerful vector database and vector similarity search engine
  designed to power the next generation of AI applications. It deploys as an API
  service, providing search for the nearest high-dimensional vectors. This
  allows embeddings or neural network encoders to be turned into full-fledged
  applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more. Qdrant
  supports a large variety of data types and query conditions, including string
  matching, numerical ranges, geo-locations, and more. It is cloud-native and
  scales horizontally, ensuring efficient utilization of resources. With Qdrant,
  you can build and deploy semantic neural search on your data in minutes,
  understand user behavior in real time, and find similar images or detect
  duplicates with ease.

benefits:
  - title: Advanced Vector Similarity Search
    description:
      Qdrant is a next-generation AI application that leverages advanced vector
      similarity search technology. It allows you to turn embeddings or neural
      network encoders into full-fledged applications for matching, searching,
      recommending, and much more.
  - title: Fast and Accurate
    description:
      Qdrant implements a unique custom modification of the HNSW algorithm for
      Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search. It provides state-of-the-art speed
      and applies search filters without compromising on results.
  - title: Efficient and Scalable
    description:
      Qdrant is cloud-native and scales horizontally. It effectively utilizes
      your resources and can be used with just the right amount of computational
      resources, no matter how much data you need to serve.
  - title: Rich Data Types and Custom Business Logic
    description:
      Qdrant supports a large variety of data types and query conditions. It
      allows you to build almost any custom business logic that should work on
      top of similarity matching.
features:
  - title: Easy to Use API
    description:
      Qdrant provides the OpenAPI v3 specification to generate a client library
      in almost any programming language. You can also utilize ready-made
      clients for Python or other programming languages with additional
      functionality.
  - title: Filterable
    description:
      Qdrant supports additional payload associated with vectors. It not only
      stores payload but also allows filter results based on payload values.
      Unlike Elasticsearch post-filtering, Qdrant guarantees all relevant
      vectors are retrieved.
  - title: Semantic Text Search
    description:
      Qdrant allows you to overcome the limitations of full-text search by using
      a neural network-based semantic search. It uses semantic embeddings to
      find texts with similar meaning.
  - title: Real-Time User Behavior Understanding
    description:
      With Qdrant, user behavior can be represented as a semantic vector similar
      to text or images. This vector can represent user preferences, behavior
      patterns, or interest in the product. User vectors can be updated in
      real-time, eliminating the need to deploy a MapReduce cluster.
  - title: Similar Image Search
    description:
      Qdrant allows you to find similar images, detect duplicates, or even find
      a picture by text description. It enables you to apply arbitrary business
      logic on top of a similarity search.
