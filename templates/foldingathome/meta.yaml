name: Folding@Home
description:
  Folding@Home is a distributed computing project that simulates protein folding
  and other molecular dynamics to help researchers understand how proteins work
  and how they can malfunction. By donating your unused computing power, you
  become a citizen scientist contributing to research on diseases like COVID-19,
  Alzheimer's, cancer, and many others. The project uses your computer to run
  simulations that help scientists develop new treatments and understand
  biological processes.
