name: Keycloak
description: Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management tool that
  adds authentication to applications and secures services with minimal effort.
  It eliminates the need for storing or authenticating users by providing user
  federation, strong authentication, user management, and fine-grained
  authorization. Keycloak offers single-sign on, allowing users to authenticate
  with Keycloak rather than individual applications, meaning users only need to
  log in once to access multiple applications. It also supports social login and
  identity brokering, enabling users to log in with social networks and
  authenticate with existing OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 Identity Providers.
  Keycloak can connect to existing LDAP or Active Directory servers and allows
  administrators to centrally manage all aspects of the Keycloak server through
  the admin console. Users can manage their own accounts through the account
  management console. Keycloak is based on standard protocols and provides
  support for OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.
