name: Convex
description:
  Convex is the open-source reactive database and backend platform designed for
  modern app developers. It provides real-time data synchronization,
  TypeScript-first development, and built-in features like authentication, file
  storage, and serverless functions. The self-hosted version includes the main
  backend service, dashboard for data management, and PostgreSQL database
  support. Perfect for building full-stack applications with automatic caching,
  real-time updates, and strong consistency guarantees.
instructions: You have to generate the admin key from the backend bash console. Run "./generate_admin_key.sh" and copy it. Go to the dashboard and login.
