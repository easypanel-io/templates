  and lightweight comments box for your static website. It offers a range of
  features including Markdown support, Disqus import, voting, automated spam
  detection, moderation tools, sticky comments, thread locking, OAuth login,
  hot-reloading of comments, and email notifications. It is designed to respect
  your privacy with no adverts and offers a more attractive comments box
