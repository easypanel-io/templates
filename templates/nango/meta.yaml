  Nango is a powerful app designed to simplify and accelerate the process of
  building integrations. It provides a unified API, allowing you to drastically
  simplify your integration code and avoid dealing with each external API's
  schema and quirks. With Nango, you can authorize any integration using our
  drop-in UI, and securely manage your users' credentials. The app also enables
  continuous data synchronization with external APIs, using one of 100+
  pre-built integrations, or you can customize them or build your own. Nango
  also supports 2-way syncs, write-backs, and real-time webhooks. It's designed
  for engineering teams that want full control without the hassle, allowing you
  to build exactly the integration your customers need, in code. With Nango, you
  can leave the maintenance, scaling, and API specific quirks to us, and focus
  on what you do best.
