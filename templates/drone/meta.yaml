name: Drone
description: Drone is a self-service Continuous Integration platform designed to
  automate software build and testing for busy development teams. It allows you
  to configure pipelines with a simple, easy-to-read file that you commit to
  your git repository. Each step in the pipeline is executed inside an isolated
  Docker container that is automatically downloaded at runtime. Drone integrates
  seamlessly with multiple source code management systems, including GitHub,
  GitHubEnterprise, Bitbucket, and GitLab. It supports multiple operating
  systems and architectures, and works with any language, database or service
  that runs inside a Docker container. You can choose from thousands of public
  Docker images or provide your own. Drone also allows you to create and share
  plugins, and makes advanced customization easy. It ensures that every build
  runs in an isolated Docker container, giving you full control, and scales
  automatically.
