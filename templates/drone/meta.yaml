  Drone.io is a self-service Continuous Integration platform designed for busy
  development teams. It automates software build and testing, making it an
  essential tool for efficient and effective software development. Drone.io is
  configured with a simple, easy-to-read file that you commit to your git
  repository, and each pipeline step is executed inside an isolated Docker
  container that is automatically downloaded at runtime. The platform integrates
  seamlessly with multiple source code management systems, including GitHub,
  GitHubEnterprise, Bitbucket, and GitLab, and supports multiple operating
  systems and architectures. Drone.io works with any language, database or
  service that runs inside a Docker container, and allows you to create and
  share plugins for pre-configured steps in your pipeline. Advanced
  customization is made easy with Drone.io, with features for implementing
  custom access controls, approval workflows, secret management, yaml syntax
  extensions and more. The platform also ensures isolated builds to avoid
  conflicts on shared servers, and offers effortless scaling.
